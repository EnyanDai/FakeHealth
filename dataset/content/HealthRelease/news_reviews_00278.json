The largest study comprised approximately 230,000 Finnish women and the follow-up time in different studies was up to 20 years.\n\nMenopause may explain women's higher dementia risk\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, and two out of three Alzheimer's cases are women. One possible explanation for women's higher dementia risk is the postmenopausal depletion of sex steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen receptors are present throughout the body including brain areas primarily affected in Alzheimer's disease. In in vitro and animal studies, estrogen has showed neuroprotective effects. However, studies on humans have yielded inconsistent results on the association between postmenopausal estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy and dementia risk.\n\nHormonal therapy may protect cognition if started at the onset of menopause\n\nIn the present study, long-term use of hormonal replacement therapy was associated with a better performance in certain cognitive domains - global cognition and episodic memory - and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Short-term use was not significantly linked to dementia risk, but in one cohort, dementia risk was higher among short-term users who had started hormone therapy in the late postmenopausal period. The results were adjusted for various lifestyle, socioeconomic and demographic variables.\n\n\"In the light of these findings, hormonal replacement therapy may have a beneficial effect on cognition if started early, around the time of menopause. The protective effect of hormonal therapy may depend on the health status of neurons at baseline and may be lost if therapy starts years after menopause,\" Dr Imtiaz concludes.\n\nThe study also showed that the postmenopausal removal of ovaries, uterus or both was not significantly linked to the risk of Alzheimer's disease, irrespective of the indication of surgery or hormone therapy use.\n\nThe research data was from the MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer's disease), OSTPRE (Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study) and CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) studies. The newest results were published recently in Neurology and Maturitas and the earlier results in the Journal of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n###\n\nBushra Imtiaz's doctoral thesis Hormone therapy and the risk of dementia, cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease is available for download at: http://epublications. uef. fi/ pub/ urn_isbn_978-952-61-2403-2/ index_en. html\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nBushra Imtiaz, MD, MPH\n\nUniversity of Eastern Finland\n\nNeurology\n\nbushra.imtiaz@uef.fi or bushraali2007@gmail.com\n\nAnna-Maija Tolppanen\n\nAcademy Research Fellow, Associate Professor\n\nUniversity of Eastern Finland\n\nSchool of Pharmacy\n\ntel. +358 50575 9530\n\nanna-maija.tolppanen@uef.fi\n\nRecent publications:\n\nPostmenopausal hormone therapy and Alzheimer's disease, a prospective cohort study.
