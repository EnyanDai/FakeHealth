providing the equivalent of 230g of blueberries - once a day, while 14 received a placebo.\n\nBefore and after the 12-week period, participants took a range of cognitive tests while an MRI scanner monitored their brain function and resting brain blood flow was measured.\n\nCompared to the placebo group, those who took the blueberry supplement showed significant increases in brain activity in brain areas related to the tests.\n\nThe study excluded anyone who said they consumed more than five portions of fruit and vegetables per day, and all participants were told to stick to their normal diet throughout.\n\nPrevious research has shown that risk of dementia is reduced by higher fruit and vegetable intake, and cognitive function is better preserved in healthy older adults with a diet rich in plant-based foods.\n\nFlavonoids, which are abundant in plants, are likely to be an important component in causing these effects.\n\n###\n\nThe new paper, \"Enhanced task-related brain activation and resting perfusion in healthy older adults after chronic blueberry supplementation\", is published in the journal Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism.\n\nThe research was carried out in association with the University of the West of England, and the concentrated blueberry juice (BlueberryActive) and some funding for the study was provided by CherryActive Ltd, which produces cherry, beetroot and blueberry products in concentrate and capsule form.\n\nThe study was also supported by the charity BRACE, which raises funds to support dementia research.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-audio.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-cancer-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-marine-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-images.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-climate-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/AAAS-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/brand.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/EB2017_300x100.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/uoe-bci030617.php", "title": "Blueberry concentrate improves brain function in older people", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Drinking concentrated blueberry juice improves brain function in older people, according to research by the University of Exeter.", "keywords": "Medicine/Health, Diet/Body Weight, Gerontology, Aging, Neurobiology, Nutrition/Nutrients, Public Health, Sports Medicine, Mental Health, Memory/Cognitive Processes", "date": "Tue, 07 Mar 2017 05:00:00 GMT", "funder": "University of the West of England, CherryActive Ltd", "journal": "Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism", "type": "research", "institution": "University of Exeter", "region": "europe", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@EurekAlert", "creator": "uniofexeter", "domain": "www.eurekalert.org", "title": "Blueberry concentrate improves brain function in older people", "description": "Drinking concentrated blueberry juice improves brain function in older people, according to research by the University of Exeter."}, "og": {"title": "Blueberry concentrate improves brain function in older people", "description": "Drinking concentrated blueberry juice improves brain function in older people, according to research by the University of Exeter.", "site_name": "EurekAlert!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-03/uoe-bci030617.php", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170307092229im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"profile_id": "exeteruni?v=app_4949752878"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1490760000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
