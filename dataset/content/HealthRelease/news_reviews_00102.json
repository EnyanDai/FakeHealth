(Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ\u00ae, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ\u00ae is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.\n\nJet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.\n\nThe clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ\u00ae without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.\n\nResults from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Summary of Primary and Key Secondary Endpoint Results\n\nAssessment Endpoint HETLIOZ\u00ae Placebo Difference p-value Summary p-value Detail\n\nPSG TST 2/3 * 216.4 156.1 60.3 p<0.0001 3.29E-12\n\n(minutes) TST full 315.8 230.3 85.5 p<0.0001 3.74E-14\n\n\n\nLPS 21.8 36.8 -15.1 p<0.01 8.08E-03\n\n\n\nWASO 144.6 219.1 -74.6 p<0.0001 3.41E-12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKSS (1-9) average 4.0 4.5 -0.5 p<0.01 8.28E-03\n\nVAS (0-100) average 60.8 54.2 6.6 p<0.01 9.89E-03\n\n\n\n*Primary endpoint.\n\nThe results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ\u00ae to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.\n\nVanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ\u00ae in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ\u00ae is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ\u00ae will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ\u00ae will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.\n\nJet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ\u00ae was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ\u00ae improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,\" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.\n\nVanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ\u00ae in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ\u00ae is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

HETLIOZ\u00ae has been granted market authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. For full U.S. prescribing information, please visit www.hetlioz.com.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ\u00ae (tasimelteon) than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ\u00ae is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.\n\nIndication\n\nHETLIOZ\u00ae is indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24).\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nHETLIOZ\u00ae may cause somnolence: After taking HETLIOZ\u00ae, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed, because HETLIOZ\u00ae can potentially impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness.\n\nThe most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ\u00ae than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ\u00ae is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.\n\nUse of HETLIOZ\u00ae should be avoided in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, because of a potentially large increase in exposure of HETLIOZ\u00ae, and a greater risk of adverse reactions. HETLIOZ\u00ae should be avoided in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, because of a potentially large decrease in exposure of HETLIOZ\u00ae, with reduced efficacy.\n\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of HETLIOZ\u00ae in pregnant women. Based on animal data, HETLIOZ\u00ae may cause fetal harm. HETLIOZ\u00ae should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risks. Caution should be exercised when HETLIOZ\u00ae is administered to a nursing woman.\n\nHETLIOZ\u00ae has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended in these patients.\n\nSafety and effectiveness of HETLIOZ\u00ae in pediatric patients have not been established.\n\nAbout Vanda\n\nVanda is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies to address high unmet medical needs and improve the lives of patients.
