PMS symptoms occur 1 to 2 weeks before a woman's period. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms prior to menstruation. These symptoms qualify as PMS in 20% to 30% of pre-menopausal women. According to the Medical University of South Carolina, current available treatments include SSRIs and other drug treatments that treat side effects and can cost from US$60.00 - US$535.00 per month.\n\nMore than 200 different symptoms have been associated with PMS, including emotional symptoms such as: stress, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, mood swings, emotional sensitivity and/or changes in libido. Physical symptoms can include bloating, abdominal cramps, constipation, lower back pain, acne, breast swelling, muscle pain and others.\n\n\"When the benefits of phospholipids on PMS and PMDD came to light through Lipogen's research, we immediately explored its potential,\" says David Rutenberg, CEO for Lipogen. \"Realizing the significance of this discovery, it encouraged us to further explore a product line for women's health utilizing Lipogen's proprietary phospholipid ingredients.\"\n\nThe previously unrecognized PMS/PMDD benefit of PS Plus came about when 2,000 volunteers received and consumed Lipogen's PS Plus for brain health and stress management. At the end of the 2-month study, out of 220 women under the age of 40 who consumed the product regularly, 23 women (10.45%) reported that they noticed relief of premenstrual syndromes. They also reported that it helped them sleep better, experience fewer mood swings, fewer hot flashes and reduced stress.\n\n\"Based on these strong results, we improved the formulation and applied for a patent in the US market,\" explains Rutenberg. \"We also have begun an ongoing, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with daacro GmbH, Trier, Germany, to learn more how Lipogen's formulation can help alleviate PMS and PMDD symptoms. Our patented solution is made of natural ingredients, is GMO-free, and can save significant health costs over medication alternatives, all with no reported side-effects.\"\n\nWith 25 years of specializing in natural phospholipid research, development and production, Lipogen guarantees its customers ingredient systems that are supported by the highest level of scientific data, technical quality and safety to meet the growing demand for natural cognitive health solutions.\n\nVisit us at Vitafoods, Europe, Booth # M55\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\n\n\nCompany contact\n\nLipogen\n\nAriel Gordon\n\nVP Business Development\n\nTel: +972(0)52-474-2965\n\nE-mail: info@lipogenbio.com\n\nWebsite : http://www.lipogenbio.com\n\n\n\nPress Contact\n\nNutriPR\n\nLiat Simha\n\nTel: +972-9-9742893\n\nE-mail: liat@nutripr.com\n\nWebsite: http://www.nutripr.com\n\nTwitter: @LiatSimha\n\nSOURCE Lipogen Ltd.", "images": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnthumb/20160222/335617", "http://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/homepage/prn_cision_logo_mobile.png", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prn/20151116/287516LOGO?max=200", "http://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/homepage/prn_cision_logo_desktop.png", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prn/20160222/335617?max=950"], "top_img": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnthumb/20160222/335617", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lipogen Ltd."], "canonical_link": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lipogen-targets-pmspmdd-relief-naturally-569634281.html", "title": "Lipogen Targets PMS/PMDD Relief, Naturally", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "optanonhelper": "us-prod", "description": "HAIFA, Israel, February 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lipogen Ltd. attained a US patent for its proprietary phospholipid formulation designed to tackle Premenstrual...", "author": "Lipogen Ltd.", "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "cf_entity_title": "Lipogen Targets PMS/PMDD Relief, Naturally", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/common/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "google-site-verification": "xDAXH-iSoJ2LVjsJb88HI03rnWfjQ3sQcczI4-EGotQ", "naver-site-verification": "0aaad19c909a94c1b1cf1e782a10f0a6d8e14fc0", "geo.region": "united states of america", "date": "2016-02-22T07:10:00-05:00", "keywords": "Lipogen Ltd.,Health Care & Hospitals ,Medical Pharmaceuticals ,Supplementary Medicine , Health Insurance , Medical Equipment ,Pharmaceuticals   ,New Products & Services ,Women ,Clinical Trials & Medical Discoveries", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PRNewswire", "title": "Lipogen Targets PMS/PMDD Relief, Naturally", "description": "HAIFA, Israel, February 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lipogen Ltd. attained a US patent for its proprietary phospholipid formulation designed to tackle Premenstrual...", "image": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnthumb/20160222/335617"}, "og": {"title": "Lipogen Targets PMS/PMDD Relief, Naturally", "type": "website", "description": "HAIFA, Israel, February 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lipogen Ltd. attained a US patent for its proprietary phospholipid formulation designed to tackle Premenstrual...", "image": "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnthumb/20151116/287516LOGO", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lipogen-targets-pmspmdd-relief-naturally-569634281.html"}, "assetURLS": "newsmetaBean.getAssetUrls()", "robots": "index, follow"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.prnewswire.com", "summary": ""}
