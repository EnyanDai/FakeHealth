Researchers were not intervening for purposes of the study and cannot control all the natural differences that could explain the study findings.\n\nAuthors: Steven A. Narod, M.D., of Women's College Research Institute, in Ontario, Canada, and co-authors\n\nResults: A small improvement in breast cancer survival was associated with radiation plus lumpectomy for DCIS. The absolute risk reduction was 0.27 percent, making it necessary to treat 370 women to save one life. Patients who had lumpectomy plus radiation had more local recurrences than the mastectomy patients but had fewer deaths.\n\nStudy Limitations: Some data were missing; investigators didn't have information on tamoxifen use; treatments in the study population weren't randomly assigned; and the possibility remains that the decision to undergo radiotherapy was associated with other favorable prognostic factors.\n\nRelated Material: The invited commentary, \"Systemic Effects of Radiotherapy in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ,\" by Mira Goldberg, M.D., and Timothy J. Whelan, B.M., B.Ch., of McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, also is available on the For The Media website.\n\nTo Learn More: The full study is available on the For The Media website.\n\n(doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.1100)\n\nEditor's Note: The article contains conflict of interest disclosures.
