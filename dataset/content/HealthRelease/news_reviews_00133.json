CoolSculpting for the double chin is already clinically proven to reduce fat up to 20 percent in the treated area after one treatment.1\n\n\"Allergan is committed to advancing innovation for CoolSculpting\u00ae to meet the needs of patients seeking non-invasive aesthetic treatments,\" said David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer at Allergan. \"A 2017 American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) survey revealed that 73 percent of patients are bothered by excess fat under the chin.2 We are pleased this patient concern can successfully be addressed by CoolSculpting through a non-invasive approach, and furthermore improve the appearance of lax tissue in the treated area.\"\n\nAn 18-week clinical study of CoolSculpting in submental fat treatment found that 77 percent of patients showed improved appearance of lax tissue and 75 percent of patients reported their chin looked more toned following treatment.3\n\n\"In my own patients, I have noticed the improved appearance of lax tissue when using the CoolMini\u00ae applicator for the CoolSculpting\u00ae system to treat the submental area,\" said Jeffrey S. Dover, MD, FRCPC, Co-Director of SkinCare Physicians of Chestnut Hill, Mass. \"It is great to see the company invest to validate this and secure the FDA clearance.\"\n\nCoolSculpting\u00ae is available through a network of CoolSculpting\u00ae Centers worldwide.

Cleared by the FDA, CoolSculpting works by gently cooling targeted fat cells in the body to induce a natural, controlled elimination of fat cells without affecting surrounding tissue, and the treated fat cells are gone for good. Millions of CoolSculpting treatments have been performed in more than 80 countries. CoolSculpting is available through a network of CoolSculpting Centers worldwide. Dermatologists, plastic surgeons and aesthetic specialists that offer CoolSculpting can be found at www.coolsculpting.com.\n\nIn the U.S., the CoolSculpting procedure is FDA-cleared for the treatment of visible fat bulges in the submental area, thigh, abdomen and flank, along with bra fat, back fat, underneath the buttocks (also known as banana roll), and upper arm. It is also FDA-cleared to affect the appearance of lax tissue with submental area treatments.\n\nDuring the procedure you may experience sensations of pulling, tugging, mild pinching, intense cold, tingling, stinging, aching, and cramping at the treatment site. These sensations subside as the area becomes numb. Following the procedure, typical side effects include temporary redness, swelling, blanching, bruising, firmness, tingling, stinging, tenderness, cramping, aching, itching, or skin sensitivity, and sensation of fullness in the back of the throat after submental area treatment. Rare side effects may also occur. The CoolSculpting procedure is not for everyone. You should not have the CoolSculpting procedure if you suffer from cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease, or paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria. The CoolSculpting procedure is not a treatment for obesity.
