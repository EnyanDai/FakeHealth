By analyzing the level of proteins within mole cells, mass spectrometry can aid in the diagnosis of atypical moles. In this study, mass spectrometry correlated better than the gold standard of histologic examination to determine if an atypical mole was in fact benign or a melanoma. Early diagnosis of melanoma is critical to cure and long term survival.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bCalifornia Skin Institute \u2014 A recently developed test for assessing suspicious moles for melanoma is more accurate than standard analyses, according to Dr. Rossitza Lazova, a former Yale investigator. The test, which analyzes proteins in cells, could provide more reliable results for clinicians with patients who might be at risk for this deadly cancer.\n\nThe study was published on August 5th in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nMelanoma is one of the most common forms of cancer and the most serious type of skin cancer. The gold standard for diagnosing melanoma is skin biopsy followed by microscopic examination of sampled tissue. However, in up to 1 in 4 cases, the results are inconclusive.\n\nFor the study, a former associate professor of Dermatology and Pathology at Yale University, Rossitza Lazova, M.D., collaborated with a national and international team of researchers to determine whether atypical moles could be more accurately diagnosed as either benign or cancerous (melanoma) using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) \u2014 a technology that enables pathologists to focus in on individual proteins within sampled skin cells. In a prior study, the researchers used IMS to identify a molecular signature comprised of five proteins to differentiate between one type of benign mole and melanoma.\n\nThe research team retrospectively analyzed more than 100 cases of atypical moles. They compared results from IMS diagnosis to results based on standard microscopic examination of biopsies and correlated them with clinical outcomes.\n\nThe researchers found that in nearly all cases, the IMS analysis was a more accurate predictor, both of benign lesions and melanomas, than standard microscopic examination.\n\n\u201cInstead of pathologists being dependent solely upon the physical appearance of the cells, they now have the additional advantage of molecular information regarding the protein makeup [of cells] provided by mass spec imaging,\u201d said Dr. Lazova, who is corresponding author on the study. \u201cThis test integrates anatomic pathology and analytical chemistry in a very useful and meaningful way.\u201d\n\nThe finding suggests that IMS analysis, based on proteomic signatures, may improve both diagnosis and prediction of outcomes for patients with ambiguous moles, the researchers said.\n\nOther authors include Erin H.
