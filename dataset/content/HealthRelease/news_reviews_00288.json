No new safety issues were observed.\n\nThe EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial conducted in FOURIER patients also achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that Repatha was non-inferior to placebo for the effect on cognitive function.\n\nDetailed results from the Repatha FOURIER outcomes trial will be presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 66th Annual Scientific Session Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session in Washington, D.C. on Friday, March 17 at 8 a.m. ET. Detailed results from the Repatha EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial will be presented at the Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session on Saturday, March 18 at 8 a.m. ET.\n\n\"In the GLAGOV study, we demonstrated that Repatha has an effect on atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. These FOURIER results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,\" said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. \"Cardiovascular disease remains the number one health burden in the world, and we look forward to sharing these outcomes data with the scientific community at the ACC 66th Annual Scientific Session.\"\n\nFOURIER ( F urther Cardiovascular OU tcomes R esearch with PCSK9 I nhibition in Subjects with E levated R isk) is a multinational Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 27,500 patients who had either an MI, an ischemic stroke or symptomatic peripheral artery disease and an LDL \u226570 mg/dL or a non-HDL-C \u2265100 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. Patients were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly. The study continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary MACE (major adverse cardiac event) endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke, whichever occured first.\n\nEBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. Executive function (Spatial Working Memory strategy index \u2013 primary endpoint) and secondary endpoints of working memory, memory function, and psychomotor speed were assessed using a tablet-based tool (CANTAB) at baseline and select time points.\n\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.1 In the U.S., there are approximately 11 million people with ASCVD and/or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who have uncontrolled levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) over 70 mg/dL, despite treatment with statins or other cholesterol-lowering therapies.2,3 More than 60 percent of high-risk patients in Europe are still unable to adequately lower their LDL-C levels with statins or other currently approved lipid-lowering agents.4 Among very high-risk patients, the percentage is increased to more than 80 percent.4 It is estimated that less than one percent of people with FH (heterozygous and homozygous forms) in most countries are diagnosed.5\n\nFOURIER Study Design\n\nFOURIER, a multinational Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is designed to evaluate whether treatment with Repatha in combination with statin therapy compared to placebo plus statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events. The primary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke.\n\nEligible patients with high cholesterol (LDL-C \u226570 mg/dL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] \u2265100 mg/dL) and clinically evident ASCVD at more than 1,300 study locations around the world were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly plus effective statin dose; or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly plus effective statin dose. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. The study was event driven and continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary endpoint.\n\nEBBINGHAUS Study Design\n\nEBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. The primary endpoint in the study is the Spatial Working Memory strategy index of executive function. Secondary endpoints are working memory, as assessed by the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test between-errors score; memory function, as assessed by the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test; and psychomotor speed, as assessed by the CANTAB Reaction Time (RTI) test.\n\nAbout Repatha\u00ae (evolocumab)\n\nRepatha\u00ae (evolocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.6\n\nRepatha is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.\n\nImportant U.S. Product Information\n\nRepatha\u00ae is indicated as an adjunct to diet and:\n\nMaximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)\n\nOther LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C\n\nThe effect of Repatha\u00ae on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha\u00ae have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old.\n\nThe safety and effectiveness of Repatha\u00ae have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.\n\nImportant U.S. Safety Information\n\nContraindication: Repatha\u00ae is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha\u00ae.\n\nAllergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha\u00ae, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha\u00ae, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.\n\nAdverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and more common than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions.\n\nIn a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to Repatha\u00ae treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively).\n\nAdverse reactions from a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials:\n\nLocal injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha\u00ae -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in Repatha\u00ae -treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively.\n\nAllergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha\u00ae -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).\n\nNeurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in Repatha\u00ae-treated and placebo-treated patients.\n\nIn a pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1,988 patients treated with Repatha\u00ae had at least one LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and Repatha\u00ae dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by Repatha\u00ae are unknown.\n\nMusculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 14.3% of Repatha\u00ae -treated patients and 12.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than placebo were back pain (3.2% versus 2.9% for Repatha\u00ae and placebo, respectively), arthralgia (2.3% versus 2.2%), and myalgia (2.0% versus 1.8%).\n\nHomozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): In 49 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia studied in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 33 patients received 420 mg of\n\nRepatha\u00ae subcutaneously once monthly. The adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (6.1%) Repatha\u00ae-treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, included upper respiratory tract infection (9.1% versus 6.3%), influenza (9.1% versus 0%), gastroenteritis (6.1% versus 0%), and nasopharyngitis (6.1% versus 0%).\n\nImmunogenicity: Repatha\u00ae is a human monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Repatha\u00ae.\n\nPlease contact Amgen Medinfo at 800-77-AMGEN (800-772-6436) or 844-REPATHA (844-737-2842) regarding Repatha\u00ae availability or find more information, including full Prescribing Information, at www.amgen.com and www.Repatha.com.\n\nAbout Amgen Cardiovascular\n\nBuilding on more than three decades of experience in developing biotechnology medicines for patients with serious illnesses, Amgen is dedicated to addressing important scientific questions to advance care and improve the lives of patients with cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Amgen's research into cardiovascular disease, and potential treatment options, is part of a growing competency at Amgen that utilizes human genetics to identify and validate certain drug targets.
