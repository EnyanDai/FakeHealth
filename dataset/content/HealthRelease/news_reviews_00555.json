Their approach detects micrometastases, breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body. The approach may offer an improved way to detect early recurrence of breast cancer in women and men. The work was completed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland and was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cMRI has a wide array of diagnostic applications and shows promise in breast cancer detection and treatment monitoring,\u201d said Richard Conroy, Ph.D., director of NIBIB Division of Applied Science and Technology. \u201cThe technique used by researchers in this study enables very early detection of metastatic spread, which would allow adaptation of treatment more quickly and hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future.\u201d\n\nThe study, published online in the Aug. 12, 2015, issue of Nature Communications, was led by Zheng-Rong Lu, Ph.D., CWRU M. Frank Rudy and Margaret Domiter Rudy Professor of biomedical engineering and an expert in molecular imaging for cancer and other diseases.\n\n\u201cWe showed with this technique that we can detect very tiny tumors of just a few hundred cells,\u201d Lu said, adding that the study pushed imaging boundaries, revealing smaller cancers than can be detected with current clinical imaging modalities. \u201cOur imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low-risk tumors. These are two things that potentially can make a big impact on clinical practice and also management of cancer.\u201d\n\nOne-third of patients diagnosed with breast cancer eventually develop metastases in distant organs, with an increased risk of death. Breast cancer has a high rate of metastasis to bone, lung, liver, lymph nodes, and the brain. Since small, early-stage cancers are the most responsive to drug treatments, screening is an important aspect of follow-up care for breast cancer patients, and early detection is critical in tailoring appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions. While multiple imaging techniques, including MRI, are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management, they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth.\n\nThe earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases. As the name implies, they are often too small to be detected with standard screening. Dr. Lu\u2019s team used a biochemical approach combined with MRI to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases. To detect micrometastases, Lu and his team used MRI imaging \u2014 which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images \u2013 and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution.\n\nThe contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein, or peptide, tagged with a minuscule magnet. They chose the peptide \u2014 a chain of just five amino acids \u2014 for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells, called fibrin-fibronectin complexes. More importantly, the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cell\u2019s transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth, migration and differentiation. Fibronectin is associated with high-risk breast cancer with poor prognosis.\n\nThe researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors. Metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the MRI process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein.\n\n\u201cThe primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis,\u201d Lu said. \u201cBy also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide, the biomarker is enhanced, generating enough signal for MRI detection of small, high-risk cancer and micrometastases.\u201d\n\nThe researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells. After a two-week waiting period, the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed MRI. The MRI imaging detected metastatic tumors, including micrometastases, in lung, liver, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone, and brains of the mice.\n\nAnalysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes, producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue. Using a microscopic imaging approach, called cryo-imaging, and MRI, the researchers verified that the MRI technique could detect micrometastases, even observing bone micrometastases that were less than 0.5mm \u2014 the diameter of a very fine pencil lead.\n\nPrior to their study with this contrast agent, Lu\u2019s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging, which is essential for safe clinical use. Their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use.\n\n\u201cThe recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important,\u201d said Lu, adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection. \u201cWe think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic. It could also become useful as a non-invasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress.\u201d\n\nThe team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years. They will then pursue human trials with this approach.\n\nThis work was supported in part by NIH grants EB00489.\n\nAbout the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering: NIBIB\u2019s mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies.
