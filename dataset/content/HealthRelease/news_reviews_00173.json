This therapy has recently been highlighted by several professional football players traveling to Europe for treatment. The process works by using one's own blood \u2013 specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements \u2013 to end or ease pain and chronic injuries.\n\nRecently a well-known Seattle Seahawks player and four of his teammates are sitting out a week of training camp to receive a blood-healing treatment from a European supplier an IRAP-based treatment solution. Other NBA, MLB and NHL superstars have also utilized the treatment.\n\nThis treatment was developed by a German physician, Dr. Peter Wehling, in the 1980s. By using one's own blood \u2013 specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements \u2013 to end or ease pain and chronic injuries. During the process, blood is drawn from the patient and then injected back into the pained joint.\n\nA European company and their U.S. affiliate started using IRAP to treat joint pain from inflammation in the 1980s; the price reported was $10,000. The European-based process was the inspiration for Dr. Barreto of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to work on developing a stronger, more effective, and more cost-efficient version in the United States.\n\nAfter years of development and process optimization, the U.S. product IRAPjoint\u2122 is now ready. Significantly better concentration, healing/pain reduction durability, faster production (just one hour), one-fifth the price, and chemical additive free, IRAPjoint\u2122 is now available in multiple physician practices throughout the United States.\n\nIRAPjoint\u2122 is produced through a single blood draw which is enough for a full year's treatment of up to 12 injections. Typically, the treatment process is painless and just takes a few minutes and consists of one injection per week for three weeks, followed by quarterly injections, as needed. Success has been achieved in knees, hip and shoulder joints.\n\nFinally, a U.S. based company has a solution for America's professional and weekend athletes as well as those struggling with aching or arthritic joints. It's a non-drug, non-surgical treatment derived from your own blood. The cost of the USA-based IRAPjoint\u2122 treatment is $2,000 compared to the reported price of $10,000 for a foreign competitor.\n\nFor clinical or PR inquiries, please call (405) 400-0680.
