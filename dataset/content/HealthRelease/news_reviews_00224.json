The study included a liquid pharmaceutical formulation of CBD, called Epidiolex, which is manufactured by GW Pharmaceuticals and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. GW Pharmaceuticals funded the clinical trial.\n\nFor the study, 120 children and adolescents with Dravet Syndrome between the ages of 2 and 18 years were randomized across 23 sites in the United States and Europe to receive either CBD 20 mg/kg or placebo added to their existing treatment over a 14-week period. Seizure frequency was tracked for one month prior to the study for baseline readings, and during the course of the study.\n\nSpecifically, seizure frequency dropped in the CBD-treated group by 39 percent from a median of nearly 12 convulsive seizures per month before the study to about six; three patients' seizures stopped entirely. In the placebo group, there was a 13 percent reduction in seizures from about 15 monthly seizures to fourteen. The difference in the degree of seizure reduction between the CBD group and the placebo group was both statistically significant and clinically consistent.\n\nSide effects \u2013 experienced by 93.4 percent of patients in the CBD group and 74.6 percent of those treated with placebo \u2013 were generally reported as mild or moderate in severity. The most common side effects in the CBD group were vomiting, fatigue and fever. Eight participants from the CBD group withdrew from the trial due to side effects compared to one participant in the placebo group.\n\nThe new study confirms results from a December 2015 open-label expanded access program led by Dr. Devinsky that reported reductions in seizure frequency. In that program, both the researchers and patient's families knew they were receiving CBD, which may have introduced a bias into the results. This new, randomized, controlled clinical study eliminated those concerns as participants and their physicians did not know if they were on CBD or placebo, say the study authors.\n\nFuture research will look at whether safety and tolerability might be improved and whether efficacy of CBD can be maintained at lower doses. Longer term studies of CBD for Dravet Syndrome as well as for other forms of treatment-resistant epilepsy are also underway.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Devinsky, the co-authors in this study were: J. Helen Cross, PhD, FRCPCH, Linda Laux, MD, Eric Marsh, MD, Ian Miller, MD, Rima Nabbout, MD, Ingrid E Scheffer, MD, PhD , Elizabeth Thiele, MD, and Stephen Wright, MD on behalf of The Cannabidiol in Dravet Syndrome Study Group. Judith Bluvstein, MD, and Daniel Friedman, MD, also served as co-authors at the NYU Langone site involved in the study.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nRyan Jaslow\n\nryan.jaslow@nyumc.org\n\n212-404-3511\n\nSOURCE NYU Langone Medical Center\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp://www.med.nyu.edu\n\n", "images": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/homepage/prn_cision_logo_desktop.png", "http://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/homepage/prn_cision_logo_mobile.png", "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/237434/nyu_langone_medical_center_logo.jpg?p=publish&w=200", "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/515950/Devinsky_Cannabidiol_Trial_for_Severe_Epilepsy.mp4?p=medium"], "top_img": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/515950/Devinsky_Cannabidiol_Trial_for_Severe_Epilepsy.mp4?p=medium", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nyu Langone Medical Center"], "canonical_link": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cannabis-derivative-cannabidiol-reduces-seizures-in-severe-epilepsy-disorder-300463552.html", "title": "Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "optanonhelper": "us-prod", "description": "NEW YORK, May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- After years of anecdotal claims about its benefits, the cannabis derivative cannabidiol reduced seizure...", "author": "NYU Langone Medical Center", "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "cf_entity_title": "Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/common/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "google-site-verification": "xDAXH-iSoJ2LVjsJb88HI03rnWfjQ3sQcczI4-EGotQ", "naver-site-verification": "0aaad19c909a94c1b1cf1e782a10f0a6d8e14fc0", "geo.region": "new york", "date": "2017-05-24T17:00:00-04:00", "keywords": "NYU Langone Medical Center,Health Care & Hospitals ,Surveys, Polls and Research ,Clinical Trials & Medical Discoveries", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PRNewswire", "title": "Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder", "description": "NEW YORK, May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- After years of anecdotal claims about its benefits, the cannabis derivative cannabidiol reduced seizure...", "image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/515950/Devinsky_Cannabidiol_Trial_for_Severe_Epilepsy.mp4?p=medium"}, "og": {"title": "Cannabis Derivative Cannabidiol Reduces Seizures in Severe Epilepsy Disorder", "type": "website", "description": "NEW YORK, May 24, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- After years of anecdotal claims about its benefits, the cannabis derivative cannabidiol reduced seizure...", "image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/237434/nyu_langone_medical_center_logo.jpg?p=facebook", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cannabis-derivative-cannabidiol-reduces-seizures-in-severe-epilepsy-disorder-300463552.html"}, "assetURLS": "newsmetaBean.getAssetUrls()", "robots": "index, follow"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.prnewswire.com", "summary": ""}
