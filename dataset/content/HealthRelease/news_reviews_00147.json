Despite the epidemic, opioid analgesics remain a first-line treatment for moderate to severe acute pain in the emergency department. The combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen may represent an effective non-opioid alternative.\n\nWho: 416 patients (ages 21 to 64 years) with moderate to severe acute extremity pain in two urban emergency departments were randomly assigned to receive\n\n400 mg ibuprofen and 1,000 mg acetaminophen\n\n5 mg oxycodone and 325 mg acetaminophen\n\n5 mg hydrocodone and 300 mg acetaminophen; or\n\n30 mg codeine and 300 mg acetaminophen\n\nWhen: July 2015 to August 2016\n\nWhat (Study Measures): The between-group difference in decline in pain two hours after taking the study drugs.\n\nHow (Study Design): This was a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Randomized trials allow for the strongest inferences to be made about the true effect of an intervention such as a medication or a procedure. However, not all RCT results can be replicated because patient characteristics or other variables in real-world settings may differ from those that were studied in the RCT.\n\nAuthors: Andrew K. Chang, M.D., M.S., of Albany Medical College, Albany, New York, and coauthors\n\nResults: After 2 hours pain was less in all participants, without any important difference in effect between the four groups.\n\nStudy Limitations: The results apply only to pain after two hours. About 1 in 5 patients required additional medication to control their pain.\n\nStudy Conclusions: There were no important differences in pain reduction after 2 hours with ibuprofen-acetaminophen or opioid-acetaminophen combination pills in emergency department patients with acute extremity pain. The findings suggest that ibuprofen-acetaminophen is a reasonable alternative to opioid management of acute extremity pain due to sprain, strain, or fracture, but further research to assess longer-term effect, adverse events and dosing is warranted.\n\nRelated material:\n\nThe following related elements also are available on the For The Media website:\n\nThe editorial, \"Opioid vs Nonopioid Acute Pain Management in the Emergency Department,\" by Demetrios N.
