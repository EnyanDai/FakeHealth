(March 23, 2017)\u2014Statin drugs are widely used to manage high cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. But in a new review of more than 50 studies, researchers cite reductions in liver inflammation and improvements in other related factors as reasons why statins make good candidates for treating chronic liver disease. The article is published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology\u2014Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.\n\nReducing cholesterol can have a positive effect on many chronic liver disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as in biliary disorders. In some studies, the research team found that statins reduced inflammatory molecules that are typically elevated with liver disease and improved inflammation in the endothelium (cells that line the blood vessels). Statin use may also lead to:\u2022 Decreased fibrosis (hardening or scarring of tissue),\u2022 Less development of fatty liver,\u2022 Slowed or halted spread of hepatitis C virus,\u2022 Improvement of portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the liver\u2019s blood vessels), \u2022 Destruction of existing liver tumor cells, and \u2022 Reduced risk of developing liver cancer.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge that statin drugs can contribute to liver damage in some people, but for people with advanced liver disease, \u201c[s]tatins are cost-effective, generally well-tolerated by patients and the benefits of statin treatment in most patients outweigh their potential hepatotoxic risk.\u201d\n\nRead the full article, \u201cRationale for the use of statins in liver disease\u201d published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology\u2014Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.
