Since 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses a wait-and-see approach, seeking to let more earaches heal on their own without antibiotics.\n\nIn light of this, Morehouse developed a lollipop with a patented shape optimized to pull congestion out of the middle ear and into the mouth. ClearPop for Rapid Earache Relief has been shelved by Raley's (CA, NV) select RiteAid locations, and is available at boutique drugstores and Amazon. Moms have flooded https://www.facebook.com/ClearPop with glowing testimonials for this simple drug-free solution that:\n\n-doesn't require an ER or doctor visit.\n\n\n\n-can be given along with analgesics or antibiotics.\n\n-is increasingly used by frequent flyers to deal with ear pain that afflicts children disproportionately during air travel.\n\n-is naturally flavored.\n\n-is a delicious treat to a kid.\n\n\n\nCLINICAL TESTS\n\nChildren diagnosed with Acute Otitis Media, or ear infection, consumed the xylitol and Vitamin C-based product in pediatric offices. After 20 minutes, 88.5% reported their ear pain dramatically reduced or vanished. The earache episode was totally resolved for 80%. Full study report at http://clearpop.com\n\n\n\nEAR INFECTION AND ANTIBIOTICS\n\nEar infections are the Number One reason kids aged 5 and under receive oral antibiotics. Due to increasing concern about antibiotic overuse and its links to obesity, celiac disease, and Superbugs, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends against the use of antibiotics to treat routine ear infections in children over 2.\n\nABOUT CLEARPOP\n\nClearPop for Rapid Earache Relief represents a simple, safe, pediatrician recommended, clinically effective and fun way to treat earaches. ClearPop is made by Try This First, Inc. a physician-funded \"small pharma\" organization aimed at reducing the estimated 30 million antibiotics prescriptions written to children yearly for ear infection.
