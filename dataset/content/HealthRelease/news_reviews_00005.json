Compared to other technologies, the stent graft can travel through smaller, curvy vessels and better adjust to a patient\u2019s anatomy.\n\nNancy Angelino, the very first patient to undergo the procedure, feels fortunate.\n\n\u201cThis was a difficult surgery, but I knew I was in good hands,\u201d said Angelino, 85, of Culver City. \u201cI feel very lucky to have benefited from this new and improved surgical technique and for the great doctors who cared for me. After my recovery, I know I will feel stronger and healthier, and will remain forever grateful.\u201d\n\nSince Angelino\u2019s surgery, Azizzadeh who, in conjunction with medical device company Medtronic, served as the national principal investigator in clinical tests of the device \u2013 has performed several additional, successful surgeries.\n\nAneurysms are weakening, or bulging, of blood vessels that can rupture and become life-threatening. Though aneurysms can happen anywhere in the body, they most commonly happen in the brain, or in the main vessels that lead to the heart, legs and arms.\n\nRisk factors for aneurysms include heredity, smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol.", "images": ["https://seeklogo.com/images/R/rss-icon-logo-025B789EB6-seeklogo.com.png", "https://www.newswise.com/images/xfull-screen.png.pagespeed.ic.nAXcF-_0yz.png", "https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2018/12/4/Aortic_Aneurysm_12-05-18.jpg&width=100&height=100", "https://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-tw.jpg.pagespeed.ic.CuBx86pQyb.jpg", "https://www.newswise.com/assets/img/logo.png", "https://www.newswise.com/legacy/ximage.php,qimage=,_images,_uploads,_2018,_12,_4,_Aortic_Aneurysm_12-05-18.jpg,awidth=502,aheight=334.pagespeed.ic.YeuBGC25-b.jpg", "https://www.newswise.com/images/institutions/logos/xCedars-Sinai_Horz_RGB.jpg.pagespeed.ic.p-SFDGhbKz.jpg", "https://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-fb.jpg.pagespeed.ic.FG3drjR_bg.jpg", "https://www.newswise.com/assets/img/xlogo-inv.png.pagespeed.ic.ywhzXWmY-D.png", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=UeW4n1aMp410N8"], "top_img": "https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2018/12/4/Aortic_Aneurysm_12-05-18.jpg&width=100&height=100", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.newswise.com/articles/cedars-sinai-surgeon-uses-new-device-to-perform-first-ever-surgery", "title": "Cedars-Sinai Surgeon Uses New Device to Perform First-Ever Surgery", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Newswise, Aortic Aneurysm,aneurysm of the aorta,Aneurysm,Blood, Cardiovascular Health, Heart Disease, Local - California, Local - LA Metro,  Cedars-Sinai", "description": "Vascular surgeon Ali Azizzadeh, MD, was the first to use a newly approved, minimally invasive device to perform a series of innovative surgeries on patients with aneurysms of the aorta, the main vessel that delivers blood from the heart to the rest of the body.", "verify-v1": "G6V3B5za6BYmoQM4QGo6vP95BavX+zDyot3ZErFSVpQ=", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"description": "Vascular surgeon Ali Azizzadeh, MD, was the first to use a newly approved, minimally invasive device to perform a series of innovative surgeries on patients with aneurysms of the aorta, the main vessel that delivers blood from the heart to the rest of the body.", "title": "Cedars-Sinai Surgeon Uses New Device to Perform First-Ever Surgery", "type": "website", "image": "https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2018/12/4/Aortic_Aneurysm_12-05-18.jpg&width=100&height=100", "url": "https://www.newswise.com/articles/cedars-sinai-surgeon-uses-new-device-to-perform-first-ever-surgery"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.newswise.com", "summary": ""}
