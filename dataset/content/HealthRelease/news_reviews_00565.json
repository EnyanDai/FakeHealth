It also increases a patient's risk for depression, heart disease and diabetes, among other conditions. The disease affects nearly 3 percent of the world's population, according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium, but about half of all patients with psoriasis do not get any treatment, Dr. Gordon said.\n\n\"For patients, the concept that psoriasis is 'just something you live with' is no longer appropriate,\" he said.\n\nIn the multi-center trial, 293 adult patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (defined as covering 10 percent or more of the body) were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of one of the two drugs or a placebo over 52 weeks.\n\nAt weeks 16 and 40, efficacy of the drugs was measured on a scale of 0 to 5. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the guselkumab group had a score of 0 (cleared psoriasis) or 1 (minimal psoriasis) in both the short and long term periods compared to the adalimumab and placebo groups. At week 40, for example, 81 percent of patients taking a 200-mg dose of guselkumab had a score of 0 or 1, compared to 49 percent of patients taking adalimumab.\n\nThe new drug works by blocking a protein specifically implicated in psoriasis, called interluekin 23; older drugs affect the immune process more generally.\n\n\"Building on multiple layers of clinical and basic research, we are changing our understanding of how psoriasis works,\" Dr. Gordon said. \"By doing so, we are able to build new treatments that specifically target the immunological processes of psoriasis while leaving even more of the normal immune system intact.\"\n\nAn ongoing phase III trial is continuing to test the safety and efficacy of guselkumab as a psoriasis treatment.\n\n###\n\nThis study was supported by Janssen Research and Development, the manufacturer of guselkumab.
