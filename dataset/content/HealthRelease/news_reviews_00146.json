Importantly, the UroLift System provides fast and meaningful relief from BPH symptoms, improving overall quality of life for our patients.\"\n\nThe UroLift System's permanent implants, delivered during a minimally-invasive procedure, act like window curtain tie-backs to hold the lobes of an enlarged prostate open. Patients recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with minimal downtime.\n\nData from clinical trials showed that patients receiving UroLift implants reported rapid symptomatic improvement, improved urinary flow rates, and sustained sexual function. Patients also experienced a significant improvement in quality of life. Most common adverse events reported include hematuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, pelvic pain, and urge incontinence. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.\n\nThe Northwestern Medicine Urology Program ranks amongst the nation's most experienced and well respected, providing comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care, including state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment capabilities for men, women and adolescents.\n\nAbout BPH Treatment\n\nMore than 500 million aging men worldwide have an enlarged prostate. Medication is often the first line therapy but relief can be inadequate and temporary. Side effects of treatment can include sexual dysfunction, dizziness and headaches, prompting many patients to quit using the drugs. For these patients, the classic alternative is surgery that cuts or ablates prostate tissue to open the blocked urethra. While current surgical options, such as the 'gold standard' surgery, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), can be very effective in relieving symptoms, they can also leave patients with permanent side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (dry orgasm).\n\nAbout UroLift\n\nThe UroLift System provides an alternative to tissue removing surgery for the treatment of an enlarged prostate. Performed through the urethra, an urologist uses the UroLift System to push aside the obstructive prostate lobes and positions small, tailored permanent UroLift implants to hold the prostate lobes in the retracted position. This opens the urethra while leaving the prostate intact. Adverse reactions associated with UroLift System treatment were comparable to other minimally invasive surgical therapies as well as standard cystoscopy. The most common adverse events reported during the study included pain or burning with urination, blood in the urine, pelvic pain, urgent need to urinate, and the inability to control urine because of an urgent need to urinate. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.\n\nRead more about urology care at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.\n\nSOURCE Northwestern Medicine\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttps://www.nm.org\n\n", "images": ["https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600179/Northwestern_Medicine_Prostate_Before_left_and_After_right.jpg?p=publish&w=950", "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600180/Matthias_Hofer_MD_Urologist_at_Northwestern_Medicine.jpg?p=publish&w=950", "https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/homepage/prn_cision_logo_desktop.png", "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600179/Northwestern_Medicine_Prostate_Before_left_and_After_right.jpg", "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600180/Matthias_Hofer_MD_Urologist_at_Northwestern_Medicine.jpg?p=facebook", "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600180/Matthias_Hofer_MD_Urologist_at_Northwestern_Medicine.jpg", "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600213/Northwestern_Medicine_Logo.jpg?p=publish&w=200", "https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/homepage/prn_cision_logo_mobile.png"], "top_img": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600180/Matthias_Hofer_MD_Urologist_at_Northwestern_Medicine.jpg?p=facebook", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Northwestern Medicine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northwestern-medicine-offers-new-minimally-invasive-breakthrough-treatment-for-enlarged-prostate-300552589.html", "title": "Northwestern Medicine offers new Minimally Invasive Breakthrough Treatment for Enlarged Prostate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "optanonhelper": "us-prod", "description": "CHICAGO, Nov. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Northwestern Medicine's urology department is excited to announce a minimally invasive treatment option for...", "author": "Northwestern Medicine", "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "cf_entity_title": "Northwestern Medicine offers new Minimally Invasive Breakthrough Treatment for Enlarged Prostate", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/common/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "google-site-verification": "xDAXH-iSoJ2LVjsJb88HI03rnWfjQ3sQcczI4-EGotQ", "naver-site-verification": "0aaad19c909a94c1b1cf1e782a10f0a6d8e14fc0", "geo.region": "illinois", "date": "2017-11-09T08:00:00-05:00", "keywords": "Northwestern Medicine,Health Care & Hospitals ,Medical Pharmaceuticals ,Clinical Trials & Medical Discoveries,Not For Profit , FDA Approval", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PRNewswire", "title": "Northwestern Medicine offers new Minimally Invasive Breakthrough Treatment for Enlarged Prostate", "description": "CHICAGO, Nov. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Northwestern Medicine's urology department is excited to announce a minimally invasive treatment option for...", "image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600180/Matthias_Hofer_MD_Urologist_at_Northwestern_Medicine.jpg?p=twitter"}, "og": {"title": "Northwestern Medicine offers new Minimally Invasive Breakthrough Treatment for Enlarged Prostate", "type": "website", "description": "CHICAGO, Nov. 9, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Northwestern Medicine's urology department is excited to announce a minimally invasive treatment option for...", "image": "https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/600213/Northwestern_Medicine_Logo.jpg?p=facebook", "url": "https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/northwestern-medicine-offers-new-minimally-invasive-breakthrough-treatment-for-enlarged-prostate-300552589.html"}, "assetURLS": "newsmetaBean.getAssetUrls(,)", "robots": "index, follow"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.prnewswire.com", "summary": ""}
