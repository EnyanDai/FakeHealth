The discovery was a \u201cserendipitous finding\u201d in the lab of Rajan Sah, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Iowa.\n\n\u201cWhen we exercise and move our muscles, we activate calcium cycling to cause muscle contraction,\u201d said Sah. \u201cThis same calcium signal also activates signaling pathways to increase skeletal muscle endurance and also skeletal muscle size.\u201d\n\nSah\u2019s research team hypothesized that low level calcium cycling induced by these natural compounds might promote improved exercise capacity and overall metabolic health associated with healthy muscle mass.\n\n\u201cWe tested these compounds in sedentary mice and found a dramatic improvement in exercise endurance and a mild increase in muscle size of certain muscle groups,\u201d Sah says.\n\nThe intellectual property associated with this discovery was recently licensed by the UI Research Foundation to Innovus Pharma, an over-the-counter consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company that commercializes non-prescription medicine and consumer care products. The company plans to develop the discovery into an over-the-counter (OTC) product to combat cachexia.\n\n\u201cThe oncology supportive care market is a very large unmet medical market with limited choices to both physicians and patients,\u201d said Bassam Damaj, chief executive officer of Innovus Pharma. \u201cThe treatment of cachexia just doesn\u2019t exist. It is a miserable, frequent event that every physician knows about and many patients experience, but there is simply little available against it and nothing to prevent it.\u201d", "images": ["https://seeklogo.com/images/R/rss-icon-logo-025B789EB6-seeklogo.com.png", "https://www.newswise.com/images/new-newswise-logo-square.jpg", "https://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-tw.jpg.pagespeed.ic.CuBx86pQyb.jpg", "https://www.newswise.com/assets/img/logo.png", "https://www.newswise.com/assets/img/xlogo-inv.png.pagespeed.ic.ywhzXWmY-D.png", "https://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-fb.jpg.pagespeed.ic.FG3drjR_bg.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=UeW4n1aMp410N8"], "top_img": "https://www.newswise.com/images/new-newswise-logo-square.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Oregano, Thyme May Hold the Cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Newswise, Wasting Disease,Health Care,Cachexia,Drugs,Pharmaceucticals,Food,Herbs,Food Science, Health Food, Nutrition, Local - Iowa,  University of Iowa", "description": "Fresh thyme and oregano offer a savory touch to a tasty dish, but a University of Iowa researcher recently discovered natural compounds in the herbs that may offer a treatment for cachexia or \u201cwasting syndrome\u201d as it is more commonly known.", "verify-v1": "G6V3B5za6BYmoQM4QGo6vP95BavX+zDyot3ZErFSVpQ=", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"description": "Fresh thyme and oregano offer a savory touch to a tasty dish, but a University of Iowa researcher recently discovered natural compounds in the herbs that may offer a treatment for cachexia or \u201cwasting syndrome\u201d as it is more commonly known.", "title": "Oregano, Thyme May Hold the Cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease", "type": "website", "image": "https://www.newswise.com/images/new-newswise-logo-square.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.newswise.com", "summary": ""}
