The weeklong conference is hosted by the\n\nAmericanSociety for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The ObesitySociety (TOS).\n\nAllurionTechnologies, the manufacturer of the device called Elipse\uf0d4, whichis not yet commercially available, is studyingwhat it says is the \u201cfirst procedureless gastric balloon\u201d inpatients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more.\n\nThetreatment involves patients swallowing a capsule that quicklydissolves in the stomach to reveal a deflated gastric balloon inside.With a thin catheter attached to the device, but long enough toremain outside the patient\u2019s mouth, a physician fills the balloonwith fluid (550 mL) to about the size of a grapefruit. The catheteris then removed, while the balloon remains in the stomach for fourmonths. At that point, a valve designed to open on its own, allowsthe balloon to empty and be excreted naturally from the body,eliminating the need for endoscopy or another procedure.\n\n\u201c Likeother gastric balloons, the mechanism of action of Elipse is likelymultifactorial and includes increased satiety from the reduction ofavailable space in the stomach, delayed gastric emptying, and changesin hormones that control hunger and appetite,\u201d saidRam Chuttani, MD*, study co-author and director of Endoscopy andchief, Interventional Gastroenterology at Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center in Boston. \u201cOur findings demonstrate that Elipseprovides individuals and their caregivers with a safe, effective, andnon-invasive weight loss intervention that does not require surgery,endoscopy, or anesthesia.\u201d\n\nResearcherspresented interim results for the first 34 patients of a multi-centerstudy that showed individuals lost an average of 22 pounds after fourmonths or 37 percent of their excess weight. Patients also sawimprovements in triglycerides and hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) levels,risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. Similar to othergastric balloons, the most common adverse events reported were nauseaand vomiting.\n\nNinhT. Nguyen, MD, immediate pastpresident of the ASMBS and vice-chair, UC Irvine Department ofSurgery and chief of gastrointestinal surgery, who was not involvedin the study said the device is not a permanent solution to weightloss, but has the potential to help those individuals who areoverweight or have obesity and are not candidates for bariatricsurgery.\n\n\u201c Newtreatment options are being studied and approved for the treatment ofobesity, which is good news for our patients and the healthcareprofessionals involved in their treatment,\u201d said Dr. Nguyen, whowas not involved in the study. \u201cFor many struggling with theirweight, procedureless gastric balloon devices may serve as atreatment option that bridges the gap between weight-loss drugs andsurgery.\u201d\n\nTheU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this year alone approved theOrbera\uf0e4Intragastric Balloon from Apollo Endosurgery and theReShape\uf0e4Integrated Dual Balloon System from ReShape Medical. Bothdevices are indicated for adults with BMIs between 30 and 40 whocould not lose weight through diet and exercise alone. The FDA also approved threeweight-loss drugs since 2012.\n\nInaddition to Dr. Chuttani, study authors of the abstract entitled,\u201cThe First Procedureless Gastric Balloon: A Prospective StudyEvaluating Safety, Weight Loss, Metabolic Parameters and Quality ofLife,\u201d include, Evzen Machytka MD, PhD, Martina Bojkova MD, TomasKupka MD, and Marek Buzga MSc, PhD from the University of Ostrava,Ioannis Raftopoulos MD, Andreas Giannakou MD, and Kandiliotis IoannisMD from the Iatriko Medical Center, and Kathy Stecco MD, Samuel LevyMD, and Shantanu Gaur MD, from Allurion Technologies.\n\nAboutObesity and Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery\n\nAccordingto the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 78million adults were obese in 2011\u20132012. i The ASMBS estimates about 24 million people have severe or morbidobesity. Individuals with a BMI greater than 30 have a 50 to 100percent increased risk of premature death compared to healthy weightindividuals as well as an increased risk of developing more than 40obesity-related diseases and conditions including type 2 diabetes,heart disease and cancer. ii , iii\n\nMetabolic/bariatricsurgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lastingtreatment for morbid obesity and many related conditions and resultsin significant weight loss. The Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety ofmetabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improvedlaparoscopic techniques. iv The risk of death is about 0.1 percent v and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4percent. vi\n\nAboutthe ASMBS\n\nTheASMBS is the largest organization for bariatric surgeons in thenation. It is a non-profit organization that works to advance the artand science of bariatric surgery and is committed to educatingmedical professionals and the lay public about bariatric surgery asan option for the treatment of morbid obesity, as well as theassociated risks and benefits. It encourages its members toinvestigate and discover new advances in obesity, while maintaining asteady exchange of experiences and ideas that may lead to improvedoutcomes for morbidly obese patients.
