Chemotherapy before surgery might provide a false assurance that there's no more residual cancer, whereas microscopic tumour may remain after the surgery, leading to cancer recurrence and possibly, death.\n\nThe surgery should be aggressive in an attempt to remove all visible signs of the tumour, and to avoid leaving any residual disease. The goal is to have no cancer visible to the naked eye of the surgeon after the surgery.\n\nSurgery should be followed by intraperitoneal, or localized, chemotherapy delivered to the abdomen. Localized chemotherapy works best if there's no residual cancer after the initial surgery. It is the combined effect of surgery and chemotherapy that works best.\n\n\"For decades, women have been treated with a combination of treatment options, resulting in poor prognosis for most women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, but there are many survivors as well,\" said Dr. Narod, senior scientist at Women's College Research Institute.\n\n\"Women need support to endure surgery and the rigours of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but should be encouraged to do so whenever possible, considering the potential survival benefits,\" said Narod. \"We should offer all women the possibility of a cure.\"\n\n###", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-marine.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/AM16-NoDate.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/brand.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-images.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-climate.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/AAAS-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-audio.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-cancer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/eurekalert-logo200X200.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/eurekalert-logo200X200.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-01/wch-ut5012016.php", "title": "Up to 50 percent of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer could be cured with 1 treatment model", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Up to half of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer might be cured, compared to the current 20 percent survival rate, argues Dr. Steven Narod, senior scientist at Women's College Research Institute, who calls for a new standard of treatment for women with late-stage ovarian cancer.", "keywords": "Medicine/Health, Cancer", "date": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 05:00:00 GMT", "journal": "Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology", "type": "research", "institution": "Women's College Hospital", "region": "namerica", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@EurekAlertAAAS", "creator": "EurekAlertAAAS", "domain": "www.eurekalert.org"}, "og": {"title": "Up to 50 percent of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer could be cured with 1 treatment model", "description": "Up to half of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer might be cured, compared to the current 20 percent survival rate, argues Dr. Steven Narod, senior scientist at Women's College Research Institute, who calls for a new standard of treatment for women with late-stage ovarian cancer.", "site_name": "EurekAlert!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-01/wch-ut5012016.php", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160122085550im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/eurekalert-logo200X200.gif", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"profile_id": "EurekAlert"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1454043600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
