Specifically, long-term XARELTO\u00ae use reduced the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by 32 percent and ischemic stroke alone by 31 percent compared to warfarin, with no significant increase in major bleeding. Results from the study, which also assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dabigatran each versus warfarin, were recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.\n\nClick to Tweet: New two-year real-world data show Janssen blood thinner significantly reduced stroke in frail NVAF patients #JAHA #RWE #AFib https://ctt.ac/z3t2a+\n\nAffecting nearly six million Americans, NVAF increases a person's risk of stroke by five times and accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all strokes.i,ii Frailty is a common clinical syndrome mainly seen in older adults that makes it harder for them to recover from stressful cardiovascular events and vulnerable for poorer health outcomes. People with NVAF are four times more likely to be classified as frail than people without NVAF,iii and research has shown frail people with NVAF are less likely to receive anticoagulation than non-frail people.iv,v,vi\n\n\"There is not widespread consensus on the best way to manage frail patients with NVAF in clinical practice, which is why some patients are not treated at all and remain at high risk of having a stroke,\" said Craig Coleman, PharmD, Professor of Pharmacy Practice, University of Connecticut. \"These results show long-term rivaroxaban use reduced stroke and systemic embolism in a vulnerable patient group, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. They also give physicians important insights into a well-tolerated, effective approach to treat their frail patients with NVAF.\"\n\nIn the study, researchers used U.S. Truven MarketScan claims data and identified frail patients with NVAF taking XARELTO\u00ae, apixaban, or dabigatran. Each treatment group was matched separately with warfarin users in a 1:1 ratio and followed for up to two years or until an event, insurance disenrollment or end of follow-up occurred. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Major bleeding was the primary safety outcome.\n\nResearchers made the following two-year observations:\n\nXARELTO \u00ae was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin.\n\nwas associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin. XARELTO \u00ae had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32).\n\nhad similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32). Though both apixaban and dabigatran treatment were associated with numerically fewer strokes, neither statistically significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at two years compared to warfarin (HR=0.78; 95% CI=0.46-1.35 and HR=0.94; 95% CI=0.60-1.45).\n\nRates of major bleeding were also evaluated for apixaban versus warfarin (HR=0.72; 95% CI=0.49-1.06) and dabigatran versus warfarin (HR=0.87; 95% CI=0.63-1.19).\n\n\"This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive efficacy and safety profile of XARELTO\u00ae across a broad spectrum of patients with NVAF, which now includes the frail population,\" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Real-world data like this study are critical to informing and helping physicians best treat their patients' cardiovascular diseases.\"\n\n\n\nAbout the Frailty Study\n\nA total of 19,077 patients were identified using claims data from U.S. MarketScan databases from November 2011 to December 2016. These patients were new users of anticoagulant therapy with XARELTO\u00ae, apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin, who had not been previously treated with an anticoagulant. They also had at least 12 months of continuous insurance coverage, and were considered frail. Frailty was determined using the Johns Hopkins Claims-based Frailty Indicator scoring algorithm, which weighs 21 criteria identifiable in claims data, including demographics, comorbidities, and physical and cognitive dysfunction.\n\nEach eligible XARELTO\u00ae, apixaban, and dabigatran user was propensity score matched to a warfarin user in a 1:1 ratio, which helped minimize the presence of baseline differences between cohorts. A total of 10,754 patients were included in the retrospective study, with 2,635 taking XARELTO\u00ae, 1,392 apixaban, 1,350 dabigatran, and 5,377 warfarin. This study was supported by Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.\n\nReal-world data have the potential to supplement randomized controlled trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice; however, they have limitations and cannot be used as stand-alone evidence to validate the efficacy and/or safety of a treatment.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, it is possible some of the analyses within this specific study may not have been sufficiently powered based on smaller sample sizes.\n\nAbout Real-World XARELTO\u00ae Research\n\nXARELTO\u00ae is the most-studied oral Factor Xa inhibitor in the world today. More than 200,000 people have been evaluated in published real-world research since the approval of XARELTO\u00ae across all approved indications in the U.S. Post-marketing studies and registries continue to confirm the safety and efficacy of XARELTO\u00ae in routine clinical use across a broad spectrum of patients. There have been no head-to-head randomized trials directly comparing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.\n\nOne recent study, REVISIT-US, found XARELTO\u00ae is providing an appropriate balance of benefit and risk with respect to ischemic stroke and found a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage in routine clinical practice. These are two of the most serious types of events physicians work the hardest with their patients to avoid, given their potential for irreversible harm.\n\nWHAT IS XARELTO\u00ae?\n\nXARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO\u00ae and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWhat is the most important information I should know about XARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban)?\n\nFor people taking XARELTO\u00ae for atrial fibrillation:\n\nPeople with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO\u00ae lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO\u00ae, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.\n\nDo not stop taking XARELTO\u00ae without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO\u00ae increases your risk of having a stroke.\n\nIf you have to stop taking XARELTO\u00ae, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO\u00ae is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO\u00ae you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.\n\nYou may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO\u00ae and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:\n\nAspirin or aspirin-containing products\n\n\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\n\n\nWarfarin sodium (Coumadin \u00ae , Jantoven \u00ae )\n\n, Jantoven )\n\nAny medicine that contains heparin\n\n\n\nClopidogrel (Plavix \u00ae )\n\n)\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n\n\nOther medicines to prevent or treat blood clots\n\nTell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.\n\nCall your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:\n\nUnexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:\n\nNosebleeds that happen often\n\n\n\nUnusual bleeding from gums\n\n\n\nMenstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding\n\nBleeding that is severe or you cannot control\n\nRed, pink, or brown urine\n\nBright red or black stools (looks like tar)\n\nCough up blood or blood clots\n\nVomit blood or your vomit looks like \"coffee grounds\"\n\nHeadaches, feeling dizzy or weak\n\nPain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites\n\nSpinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma): People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO \u00ae , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis).
