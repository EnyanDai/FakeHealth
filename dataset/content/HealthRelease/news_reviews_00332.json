OsteoRx\u2122 is a new joint health system comprised of an OTC topical analgesic combined with a natural antioxidant to support overall joint health.\n\nAn independent clinical research organization conducted the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study by enrolling 60 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the knee. Measurements in the level of pain and range of motion in the affected knee were recorded over a 14-day period for each patient. Independent statistical experts determined that, over the course of the study, patients using OsteoRx\u2122 experienced significantly higher reduction in pain and significantly greater improvement in range of motion than did patients using the competing product.\n\nAfter 48 hours, the average pain reduction for OsteoRx\u2122 users was nearly three times greater than for patients using the competing brand. At seven days, average pain reduction was more than three times greater than the competition. After 14 days of treatment, average pain reduction was more than twice as large as the competition.\n\nAfter just 24 hours, patients using OsteoRx\u2122 experienced an average improvement in range of motion that was more than twice as large as the competition. At 72 hours, OsteoRx\u2122 results were nearly five and a half times better. After 14 days of treatment, the average improvement was still nearly twice as large as the competition.\n\n\"Joint pain associated with normal aging and over-exercising is extremely common,\" said Thomas Sullivan, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of HSRx Biopharmaceutical. \"Research funded by U.S. National Academy of Medicine shows that 70 million adults suffer from joint pain, making it the most prevalent source of pain. With the dramatic treatment outcomes delivered by OsteoRx\u2122, demand for our product should be significant.\"\n\n\"All HSRx OTC drug products are designed to become category leaders,\" noted Frank Parise, the company's Chief Financial Officer. \"We demonstrated superior treatment outcomes with our acne product in a head-to-head clinical trial against the market-leader, and now we've done the same with OsteoRx\u2122. We are actively seeking the best-suited licensees having resources and marketing expertise to maximize sales for each of our products in the U.S. and globally.\"\n\nAbout HSRx Biopharmaceutical\n\nHSRx Biopharmaceutical, an Arizona-based biopharmaceutical company, is a leader in the development of monographed OTC Drug products that are formulated with proprietary natural ingredients.
