The new blood tests identify the presence and amount of specific antibodies reacting to the toxins.\n\n\"Having an early diagnosis means patients can avoid years of invasive tests and visits to specialists that often leave them with more questions than answers,\" he said. \"With these new blood tests, many patients will now be able to proceed right to therapy for their condition.\"\n\nIBS is the most common gastroenterological disorder in the United States, affecting nearly 40 million people. An estimated 10 percent of the world's population suffers from the condition.\n\nThe disorder, nearly impossible to diagnose until now, is characterized by a cluster of confounding symptoms that include chronic bloating, abdominal pain, gas, and bouts of relentless diarrhea, constipation, or both. Fatigue and the stress of trying to plan one's life around visits to the bathroom can be debilitating.\n\nA multicenter study validating the accuracy of the new blood tests, \"Development and Validation of a Biomarker for Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Human Subjects,\" was published this week in the journal PLOS ONE. Pimentel will also present the research on Sunday, May 17th, at Digestive Disease Week 2015 in Washington, D.C.\n\nPimentel and fellow researchers studied nearly 3,000 people, comparing IBS patients to those diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and those with no GI disease. The blood tests identified the two antibodies associated with IBS -- anti-Cdtb and anti-vinculin -- with greater than 90 percent certainty.\n\nThe tests are marketed under the name IBSchek\u2122 and are produced by Commonwealth Laboratories Inc., in Salem, Massachusetts.\n\n\"Most IBS patients have been told at one time or another that the disease was psychological, all in their head,\" said Pimentel. \"The fact that we can now confirm the disease through their blood, not their head, is going to end a lot of the emotional suffering I have seen these patients endure.\"\n\nFor more information on IBS and the new blood test for the disorder, watch this video:\n\nFirst Ever Blood Test for IBS\n\nCOI Disclosure: Pimentel receives consulting fees from Commonwealth Laboratories.\n\nCedars-Sinai has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Commonwealth Laboratories for several patent applications covering the blood tests, developed by Pimentel to detect both anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n###", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/brand.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/eurekalert-logo200X200.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-audio.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-cancer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-marine.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-images.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-climate.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/AAAS-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/eurekalert-logo200X200.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/cmc-dtf051415.php", "title": "Definitive tests for irritable bowel syndrome developed at Cedars-Sinai", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Millions of people afflicted by irritable bowel syndrome can now be diagnosed quickly and accurately with two simple blood tests developed by a Cedars-Sinai gastroenterologist.", "keywords": "Medicine/Health, Gastroenterology", "date": "Thu, 14 May 2015 04:00:00 GMT", "journal": "PLOS ONE", "type": "research", "institution": "Cedars-Sinai Medical Center", "meeting": "Digestive Disease Week", "region": "namerica", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@EurekAlertAAAS", "creator": "cedarssinai", "domain": "www.eurekalert.org"}, "og": {"title": "Definitive tests for irritable bowel syndrome developed at Cedars-Sinai", "description": "Millions of people afflicted by irritable bowel syndrome can now be diagnosed quickly and accurately with two simple blood tests developed by a Cedars-Sinai gastroenterologist.", "site_name": "EurekAlert!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/cmc-dtf051415.php", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150517004549im_/http://www.eurekalert.org/images/eurekalert-logo200X200.gif", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"profile_id": "CedarsSinai"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1432872000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
