In Australia, it is the single leading cause of death in Australia, affecting 4.2 million Australians and killing one Australian every 12 minutes. Low-fat diets are often recommended as suitable food plans for those seeking to reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to deliver significant health benefits.\n\nIn this UniSA study, published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers compared the health benefits of a MedDiet supplemented with two to three serves of dairy each day, and a generic low-fat diet.\n\nThe results show that the dairy-supplemented MedDiet (MedDairy) significantly improved blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, mood and cognitive function.\n\nPhD candidate Alexandra Wade says the new MedDairy diet challenges popular perceptions of what is considered healthy.\n\n\u201cThe MedDiet is fast earning a reputation as the world\u2019s healthiest diet and is renowned for delivering improved cardiovascular and cognitive health,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also higher in fat, which can be a deterrent for people seeking to adopt a healthier eating plan, especially if they don\u2019t realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy fats.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, low-fat diets are often recommended for improving heart health and they are still perceived as being healthy.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that the new MedDairy works better than a generic low-fat diet, ensuring better health outcomes for people at risk of cardiovascular disease.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the MedDairy diet also meets additional calcium requirements recommended by Australia\u2019s national health bodies.\n\nA typical MedDiet includes extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, moderate consumption of fish and red wine, and low consumption of red meat, sweet and processed foods. It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.\n\n\u201cLiving in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,\u201d Wade says.\n\n\u201cThese needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.\n\n\u201cThis study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, women up to age 50 years \u2013 and men up to age 70 years \u2013 should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.\n\n\u201cThe new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet. And if you\u2019re one of the thousands of people seeking to improve your cardiovascular and cognitive health \u2013 look no further than the MedDairy diet.\u201d\n\nNotes to editors:\n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in Australia, with 43,477 deaths attributed to CVD in Australia in 2017.
