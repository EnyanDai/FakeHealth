This suggests that including the scans in routine care would not lead to a surge in costly tests or additional heart surgery, the researchers say.\n\nPatients who are at risk of a heart attack are frequently diagnosed with a test called an angiogram. This involves inserting tubes into the body and heart to check the flow of blood and identify any obstructions that could pose a heart attack risk.\n\nCTA scans enable doctors to look at the blood vessels from the outside the body, without the need to insert tubes into the heart. The scans are cheaper, quicker and safer than angiograms.\n\nThe study had previously found that around a quarter of patients had their diagnoses reclassified after receiving the scan, prompting new treatments in many cases.\n\nThis is the first study to look at the impact of the scans on long-term survival rates.\n\nLead researcher Professor David Newby, of the BHF Centre for Cardiovascular Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This relatively simple heart scan ensures that patients get the right treatment. This is the first time that CT guided management has been shown to improve patient outcomes with a major reduction in the future risk of heart attacks. This has major implications for how we now investigate and manage patients with suspected heart disease.\"\n\n###\n\nThe research is published in the New England Journal of Medicine and is being presented at the European Society of Cardiology Annual Congress in Munich.
