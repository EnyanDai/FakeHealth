Valley was the first hospital in northern New Jersey where an innovative technique \u2013 called pre-pectoral placement of a tissue expander -- was utilized during breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. The procedure results in diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome for patients.\n\nThe technique has the potential to be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43.\n\n\u201cThis variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cHere at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer.\u201d The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman\u2019s pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months \u2014 during which the woman\u2019s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin \u2014 the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,\u201d notes Dr. Small. \u201cIt is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.\u201d\n\nMs. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley\u2019s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. \u201cThis was a long journey,\u201d says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. \u201cDr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small\u2019s willingness to \u2018look outside the box\u2019 and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.\u201d Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. \u201cIt\u2019s important to listen to each woman\u2019s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,\u201d says Dr. Wilson.\n\nThe Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach. The Breast Center is designated by the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, a program of the American Cancer Society. Valley\u2019s Breast Imaging Center has been named a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology.", "images": ["https://seeklogo.com/images/R/rss-icon-logo-025B789EB6-seeklogo.com.png", "http://www.newswise.com/assets/img/xlogo-inv.png.pagespeed.ic.ywhzXWmY-D.png", "https://www.newswise.com/images/new-newswise-logo-square.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=UeW4n1aMp410N8", "http://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-fb.jpg.pagespeed.ic.FG3drjR_bg.jpg", "http://www.newswise.com/assets/img/logo.png", "http://www.newswise.com/images/institutions/logos/xval_vh2C.resized.jpg.pagespeed.ic.aOdVhMD5yN.jpg", "http://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-tw.jpg.pagespeed.ic.CuBx86pQyb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.newswise.com/images/new-newswise-logo-square.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.newswise.com/articles/new-breast-reconstruction-technique-provides-better-outcomes-less-discomfort-for-women-recovering-from-breast-cancer", "title": "New Breast Reconstruction Technique Provides Better Outcomes, Less Discomfort for Women Recovering From Breast Cancer", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Newswise, Breast Cancer,Breast Reconstruction Surgery,Cancer, Surgery, Local - New Jersey,  Valley Health System", "description": "The breast surgery and reconstructive team at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, NJ, is taking the lead in providing new and progressive advances in breast cancer surgery.
