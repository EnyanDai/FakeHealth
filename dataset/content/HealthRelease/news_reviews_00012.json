Our new test is therefore a potential game changer,\" says Professor James Paton, Director of the University of Adelaide's Research Centre for Infectious Diseases.\n\nProfessor Michael Jennings, Deputy Director of the Institute for Glycomics at Griffith University, said: \"Detection of this tumour marker may also play a role in a simple liquid biopsy to monitor disease stage and treatment.\"\n\nThe team is currently seeking scientific and commercial partners to further test the technology with larger numbers of patient samples and to adapt it for mass screening.\n\n###", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-audio.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-cancer-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-marine-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/meganav/AAAS-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/meganav/Neuroscience2018_Newsroom.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/meganav/AM19_Newsroom.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-images.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/brand.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-climate-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/uoa-nbt111918.php", "title": "New blood test detects early stage ovarian cancer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Research on a bacterial toxin first discovered in Adelaide has led to the development a new blood test for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer -- a disease which kills over 1000 Australian women and 150,000 globally each year.", "keywords": "Medicine/Health, Cancer", "date": "2018-11-19 05:00:00 GMT/UTC", "journal": "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications", "type": "research", "institution": "University of Adelaide", "region": "africa", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@EurekAlert", "creator": "UniofAdelaide", "domain": "www.eurekalert.org", "title": "New blood test detects early stage ovarian cancer", "description": "Research on a bacterial toxin first discovered in Adelaide has led to the development a new blood test for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer -- a disease which kills over 1000 Australian women and 150,000 globally each year."}, "og": {"title": "New blood test detects early stage ovarian cancer", "description": "Research on a bacterial toxin first discovered in Adelaide has led to the development a new blood test for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer -- a disease which kills over 1000 Australian women and 150,000 globally each year.", "site_name": "EurekAlert!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/uoa-nbt111918.php", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181119184643im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"profile_id": "uniofadelaide"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543467600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
