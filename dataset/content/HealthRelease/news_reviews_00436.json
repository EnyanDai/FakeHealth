Brennan, MD, study author and Chief Medical Officer, CVS Health. \"Our research shows that home infusion care is a promising model that is both cost- and clinically-effective and is overwhelmingly preferred by patients when intravenous therapy is required.\"\n\nResearchers conducted a systematic review of existing peer-reviewed research evaluating infusion care for several conditions, including cystic fibrosis, antibiotics following orthopedic surgery and several cancers requiring infused chemotherapies. Researchers compared measures of quality, safety, clinical outcomes, quality of life and costs of home infusion services to those provided in medical settings. The research showed that patients receiving intravenous therapy at home had as good or better clinical outcomes as those patients who received the same therapy in a traditional health care setting. In addition, patients overwhelmingly preferred receiving their infusion therapies at home, reporting fewer disruptions in personal schedules and responsibilities. The costs associated with home infusion were also consistently lower than services provided in a health care facility, with savings ranging between $1,928 and $2,974 per course of treatment.\n\n\"At CVS Health, we provide important home infusion services to patients through Coram, which is just one of the ways we are expanding our clinical delivery model and helping to move important health services to lower cost sites of care,\" added Alan Lotvin, MD, Executive Vice President, CVS Specialty. \"In fact, our patients report high satisfaction with our Coram home infusion services, citing convenience and comfort as key elements that improved their overall experience.\"\n\n\n\nHome infusion services are a rapidly growing delivery model in the health care system with rising rates of chronic and acute conditions that require intravenous therapy. Despite this, clinical outcomes and quality of care have not previously been systematically evaluated. While many commercial health plans provide comprehensive coverage for home infusion services, Medicare has limited reimbursement for this type of care, and Congress is discussing how to implement a comprehensive home infusion benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nCoram, a service provided by CVS Health, provides vital infusion care and support to tens of thousands of Americans each month with a range of conditions including immune deficiencies, rheumatoid arthritis and serious infections requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy. Care is administered by experienced infusion nurses and pharmacists, and in addition, patients receive additional disease management education and support throughout their treatment.\n\nThe CVS Health Research Institute is focused on contributing to the body of scientific knowledge related to pharmacy and health care through research collaborations with external academic institutions, participation in federally-funded research, analysis and sharing of CVS Health data sources and coordination of pilot programs and initiatives. CVS Health Research Institute findings support a continuous quality improvement environment, which encourages product innovation and development to benefit CVS Health patients, clients and their members.\n\nAbout CVS Health\n\nCVS Health (NYSE: CVS) is a pharmacy innovation company helping people on their path to better health.
