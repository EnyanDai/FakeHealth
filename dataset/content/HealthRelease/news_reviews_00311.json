She had exhausted all of her chemotherapy options, and this experimental treatment was her last hope. The only other option was hospice.\n\n\u201cAt least 60 to 70 percent of her body was covered by lesions, inflammation and thickened, purplish skin,\u201d said Yuan Yuan, M.D., breast cancer oncologist at City of Hope, who treated Young. \u201cSix weeks into her treatment, the skin lesions were gone, her itchiness went away. It\u2019s quite a dramatic response.\u201d\n\nSo dramatic, in fact, that Yuan refers to Young as her \u201cmiracle patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis in some ways is pretty unprecedented. This patient is at a late stage of her disease. There are no treatments available that would have done the same thing,\u201d said Don J. Diamond, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Experimental Therapeutics at City of Hope.\n\nYoung received a combination of the p53 vaccine and the drug pembrolizumab. Diamond developed the vaccine and has been studying its effectiveness in clinical trials at COH since 2010. He currently is testing it on ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal masses.\n\n\u201cI've responded great. I'm feeling good,\u201d said Young, who has received six of seven pembrolizumab infusions, each of which takes about a half-hour, and all three p53 vaccine injections. \u201cMy skin has cleared up. I think the prognosis is going to be good now.\u201d\n\nTeaching the immune system to fight\n\nThe most frequent mutation across all cancers occurs in a gene called p53, which contributes to cells becoming oncogenic when they produce a mutant form of the p53 protein (p53 gene mutations are present in about 50% of malignancies). Diamond\u2019s vaccine boosts the immune response to many different mutant forms of p53. The researchers tested this vaccine, known as p53MVA, in a 2013 clinical trial and found it to be safe in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.\n\nHowever, patients whose T cells had pre-existing high levels of a protein named PD1 \u2014 a molecule that instructs immune cells to shut down \u2014 responded poorly to the anti-p53 vaccine. In a subsequent laboratory study, the COH researchers showed that these patients\u2019 immune cells could be reactivated by treatment with a PD1 inhibitor that is a biosimilar to the clinical drug called pembrolizumab. Together, the vaccine and the drug potentially could form a potent team to reactivate the immune system to quickly clear out cancer cells.\n\nBefore Young, the combination had been tried on patients with recurrent solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and many other cancer types.\n\nSo far, while Diamond has noted an immune response in patients given the combination treatment in clinical trials, he has not seen a clinical benefit.\n\nThat is, until he met Young.\n\n\u201cWe have treated a number of different types of patients with the combination, but nothing is even in the same universe as this,\u201d he said.\n\nA 'shocking' response\n\nYoung, who tested positive for the p53 mutation, has been fighting breast cancer for eight years and has undergone \u201cone chemo after another,\u201d Yuan said.\n\nReferred to City of Hope by her physician at Davis, she began responding to the experimental treatment right away, Yuan said, her skin tumors disappearing and the latest biopsies showing no cancer. \u201cThe purple, thickened skin has faded away, the skin color has normalized. She\u2019s healed, basically,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a promising early response. It\u2019s quite unusual,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have two drugs here so it\u2019s hard to dissect which drug did what, but we do think the vaccine played a key role.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was shocking to me,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cWhat we have noticed is that her immune response to p53 has been increasing as time goes on. It was of tremendous magnitude in the last [blood] draw.\u201d\n\nThe next step will be to take bone and CT scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally, which Young will receive in a couple of weeks.\n\nEven now, though, Young is \u201cextremely happy with the results,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cHer psychological wellbeing has improved. Her appetite is better, she\u2019s more functional. She went through a lot. It will be very interesting to follow up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn't look at myself. It was really hard,\u201d Young said of the skin lesions she had endured for five years. They started to go away after the third treatment, she said. \u201cEven the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gone.\u201dFurther study needed\n\nWhat Diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients who test positive for p53. A couple of major drug companies have already expressed interest in his vaccine, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we would like is to have women come here from all over the country and the world to receive this vaccine formula so that we can test this combination,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cIf it happened once, maybe it will happen twice. But we\u2019ve got to get these patients in.\u201d\n\nFollowing the success in Young, the formula has recently been given to two other triple negative breast cancer patients at City of Hope. It\u2019s too early to gauge the response, although \u201cthe entire breast team is very excited about this,\u201d Diamond said. \u201cWe saw this phenomenal response in this patient. I am very encouraged by the findings, so I think there\u2019s a story to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is turning around for me,\u201d Young said. \u201cI was very frightened when I started out. I'm not that frightened anymore. I know it still can turn for me, but I think I'm going to be the miracle that [Dr. Yuan] wants.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2016/12/15/1430446680083-yuan-and-susan-256-x-256.jpg&width=100&height=100", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=UeW4n1aMp410N8", "http://www.newswise.com/assets/img/logo.png.pagespeed.ce.pQl5UlxZ8w.png", "http://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-tw.jpg.pagespeed.ic.CuBx86pQyb.jpg", "http://www.newswise.com/images/xfull-screen.png.pagespeed.ic.nAXcF-_0yz.png", "http://www.newswise.com/assets/img/xlogo-inv.png.pagespeed.ic.ywhzXWmY-D.png", "http://www.newswise.com/images/articlesview/xother-fb.jpg.pagespeed.ic.FG3drjR_bg.jpg", "https://seeklogo.com/images/R/rss-icon-logo-025B789EB6-seeklogo.com.png", "http://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2016/12/15/1430446680083-yuan-and-susan-256-x-256.jpg&width=502&height=334"], "top_img": "https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2016/12/15/1430446680083-yuan-and-susan-256-x-256.jpg&width=100&height=100", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.newswise.com/articles/miracle-patient-finds-new-hope-with-breast-cancer-vaccine", "title": "\u2018Miracle Patient\u2019 Finds New Hope with Breast Cancer Vaccine", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Newswise, ,Cancer, Vaccines, Local - California, Local - LA Metro,  City of Hope", "description": "City of Hope patient Susan Young has had a remarkable response to a potentially revolutionary new treatment, a combination of the p53 cancer vaccine and a drug that blocks a specific cancer-aiding protein.", "verify-v1": "G6V3B5za6BYmoQM4QGo6vP95BavX+zDyot3ZErFSVpQ=", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"description": "City of Hope patient Susan Young has had a remarkable response to a potentially revolutionary new treatment, a combination of the p53 cancer vaccine and a drug that blocks a specific cancer-aiding protein.", "title": "\u2018Miracle Patient\u2019 Finds New Hope with Breast Cancer Vaccine", "type": "website", "image": "https://www.newswise.com/legacy/image.php?image=/images/uploads/2016/12/15/1430446680083-yuan-and-susan-256-x-256.jpg&width=100&height=100", "url": "https://www.newswise.com/articles/miracle-patient-finds-new-hope-with-breast-cancer-vaccine"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.newswise.com", "summary": ""}
