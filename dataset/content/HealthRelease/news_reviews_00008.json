They are simple leaves, oblong and egg-like or oblong and elliptical in shape and between 5 and 15 cm in length. This species is native to the tropical areas of the Americas and is especially abundant in the Amazon region. It is usually cultivated for its medicinal use. The leaves have different ethnomedical uses according to their country of origin. The most important uses in traditional medicine, scientifically validated in pre-clinical tests, are for inflammation, pain, infections, diabetes and cancer.\n\n\"The consumption of extract of Annona muricata L. leaves in pharmaceutical form and in the correct dosage can reduce the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease. This extract comes from the traditional preparation using decoction\", informs the expert Ana Mar\u00eda Quilez from the Medicinal Plants research group at the University of Seville.\n\nThis study was carried out over one month using 60 five-week old female rats in the laboratories of the Faculty of Pharmacy. The animals were divided into six groups that were fed a standard diet supplement with different quantities of this plant.\n\nAfter the results obtained by the researchers, the next step will be to carry out clinical tests with patients, to corroborate the extract's activity and establish the safe and effective dose in humans.\n\nThis study was made available online in June 2018 ahead of final publication in print in October 2018.\n\n###", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-cancer-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/meganav/AM19_Newsroom.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-images.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/meganav/Neuroscience2018_Newsroom.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/meganav/AAAS-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-climate-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-audio.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/brand.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/multimedia_prod/pub/web/187142_web.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://media.eurekalert.org/multimedia_prod/pub/rel/187142_rel.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/web/187142_web.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-marine-new.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/web/187142_web.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/uos-efs112818.php", "title": "Extract from soursop leaves can prevent the symptoms of fibromyalgia", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The consumption of extract of Annona muricata L. leaves in pharmaceutical form and in the correct dosage can reduce the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease.", "keywords": "Medicine/Health, Alternative Medicine", "date": "2018-11-28 05:00:00 GMT/UTC", "journal": "Journal of Ethnopharmacology", "type": "research", "institution": "University of Seville", "region": "europe", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EurekAlert", "creator": "unisevilla", "domain": "www.eurekalert.org", "title": "Extract from soursop leaves can prevent the symptoms of fibromyalgia", "description": "The consumption of extract of Annona muricata L. leaves in pharmaceutical form and in the correct dosage can reduce the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease."}, "og": {"title": "Extract from soursop leaves can prevent the symptoms of fibromyalgia", "description": "The consumption of extract of Annona muricata L. leaves in pharmaceutical form and in the correct dosage can reduce the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease.", "site_name": "EurekAlert!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-11/uos-efs112818.php", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181128204518im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/web/187142_web.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"profile_id": "universidaddesevilla"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543467600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
