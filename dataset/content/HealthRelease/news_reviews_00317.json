The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN).\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease are advised to follow dietary recommendations that restrict individual nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium, protein, and sodium; however, empirical evidence suggests that these restrictions\u2014which can be difficult to abide by\u2014have limited effects on reducing patients\u2019 risk of premature death.\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that overall eating patterns may have greater effects on patients\u2019 health and longevity. To investigate, a tem led by Giovanni Strippoli, MD, PhD (University of Bari, in Italy and Diaverum, in Sweden), and Jaimon Kelly (Bond University, in Australia) analyzed the medical literature, finding 7 relevant studies that included a total of 15,285 participants.\n\nHealthy dietary patterns were generally higher in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and they were lower in red meat, salt, and refined sugars. In 6 studies, healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with a 20% to 30% lower rate of mortality, with 46 fewer deaths per 1000 people over 5 years. There was no significant association between healthy dietary patterns and risk of kidney failure.\n\n\u201cChronic kidney disease now affects about 10% to 13% of the adult population and substantially increases risks of cardiovascular complications and early death,\u201d said Prof. Strippoli. \u201cIn the absence of randomized trials and large individual cohort studies, this study is the best available evidence to drive clinical decision-making by patients and doctors on whole dietary approaches in chronic kidney disease.\u201d\n\nStudy co-authors include Suetonia Palmer, PhD, Shu Ning Wai, MSc, Marinella Ruospo, MSc, Juan-Jesus Carrero, PhD,and Katrina Campbell, PhD.\n\nDisclosures: The authors reported no financial disclosures.\n\nThe article, entitled \u201cHealthy Dietary Patterns, Mortality and End-Stage Kidney Disease in CKD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies,\u201d will appear online at http://cjasn.asnjournals.org/ on December 8, 2016, doi: 10.2215/CJN. 06190616.\n\nThe content of this article does not reflect the views or opinions of The American Society of Nephrology (ASN).
