Australian revised National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for obesity management say that lap band surgery should be considered in adolescents with severe obesity \u2013 that is with a body mass index (BMI) over 40 kg/m2 or over 35 kg/m2 (weight/height2) with the presence of obesity-related diseases and who don\u2019t respond to medical treatment. However there is no data available in Australian adolescents beyond 24 months post-surgery.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about a group of adolescents with severe obesity and significant health and psychological problems related to their increased weight \u2013 this is not for everyone,\u201d says corresponding author and Paediatric Endocrinologist Dr Alexia Pe\u00f1a, who is a Senior Lecturer with the University of Adelaide\u2019s Robinson Research Institute.\n\nThe study found that weight and BMI improved significantly at all follow-up times following surgery from three months through to 45 months and, in some cases, as long as five years. BMI loss was between 7.1 and 14.7 kg/m2.\n\n\u201cThe median BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 with the lap band is a good result when compared to BMI reduction using the few medications available or lifestyle measures, which is around 1-3 kg/m2,\u201d says Dr Pe\u00f1a. \u201cLap band surgery is reversible and allows time for adolescents to mature to make a more informed decision on a permanent surgical procedure if required later on in life. This is not the case for other surgeries currently offered for obesity management.\n\n\u201cIt is also important that teenagers undergoing this surgery have access to an experienced surgeon as part of a multidisciplinary paediatric team of doctors and Health professionals to ensure there is long-term regular follow-up.\u201d\n\nPaediatric surgeon Mr Sanjeev Khurana, who did all the lap band surgeries between 2009 and 2013, says lap band surgery is a reversible surgical procedure that can be safely used in teens with severe obesity.\n\n\u201cAlthough gastric banding has been controversial and is currently less used in adults with severe obesity, lap band surgery is one of the most studied surgeries for obesity management, has a high safety record and can be a temporary option to manage severe obesity during adolescence,\u201d says Mr Khurana, who is also a Senior Lecturer in the University of Adelaide\u2019s Discipline of Paediatrics.\n\n\u201cOur findings support lap band surgery as a safe and effective option for management of adolescents with severe obesity \u2013 provided it is performed by an experienced surgeon and managed afterwards in a paediatric multidisciplinary environment with regular follow-up until adulthood.\u201d\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nDr Alexia Pe\u00f1a, Paediatric Endocrinologist and Senior Lecturer, Robinson Research Institute, University of Adelaide.
