Pain scores for children in both the oral morphine and ibuprofen groups were similar, but the children receiving oral morphine reported more adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation.\n\n\"Morphine did not provide superior analgesia, but was associated with significantly more adverse effects, making ibuprofen a better analgesic option,\" write the authors.\n\nThey note that as neither treatment completely relieved pain, more research is needed into effective pain relief, especially for more severe pain.\n\nOral morphine use at home has not been previously studied in children who have had minor surgery nor has it been compared with ibuprofen.\n\n###\n\nThe study was conducted by researchers from London Health Sciences Centre, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario; Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta; and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n\"Oral morphine versus ibuprofen administered at home for postoperative orthopedic pain in children: a randomized controlled trial\" is published October 10, 2017.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/EB2017_300x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/brand.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-audio.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-images.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/AAAS-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-climate-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-marine-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/ACS2017_300x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-cancer-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-10/cmaj-ibc100417.php", "title": "Ibuprofen better choice over oral morphine for pain relief in children after minor surgery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Widely available ibuprofen is a better choice for pain relief in children who have undergone minor orthopedic outpatient surgery, as it has fewer adverse effects compared with oral morphine, according to results from a clinical trial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).", "keywords": "Medicine/Health, Clinical Trials, Orthopedic Medicine, Pain, Pediatrics, Pharmaceutical Science, Surgery", "date": "Tue, 10 Oct 2017 04:00:00 GMT/UTC", "funder": "Western University", "journal": "Canadian Medical Association Journal", "type": "research", "institution": "Canadian Medical Association Journal", "region": "namerica", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@EurekAlert", "creator": "CMAJ", "domain": "www.eurekalert.org", "title": "Ibuprofen better choice over oral morphine for pain relief in children after minor surgery", "description": "Widely available ibuprofen is a better choice for pain relief in children who have undergone minor orthopedic outpatient surgery, as it has fewer adverse effects compared with oral morphine, according to results from a clinical trial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal)."}, "og": {"title": "Ibuprofen better choice over oral morphine for pain relief in children after minor surgery", "description": "Widely available ibuprofen is a better choice for pain relief in children who have undergone minor orthopedic outpatient surgery, as it has fewer adverse effects compared with oral morphine, according to results from a clinical trial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).", "site_name": "EurekAlert!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-10/cmaj-ibc100417.php", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171010064738im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"profile_id": "CMAJ.JAMC"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509249600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
