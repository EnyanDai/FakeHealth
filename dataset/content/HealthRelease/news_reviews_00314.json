The infants were randomized to 1 of 4 groups: placebo control; video instruction to parents on how to soothe their baby; video plus oral sugar solution; and video, oral sugar solution and lidocaine applied to the skin.\n\n\"We found that, when used consistently during vaccine injections in the first year of life, only liposomal lidocaine combined with parental video instruction and orally administered sucrose showed a benefit on acute pain when compared with placebo, video alone, and video and sucrose together,\" wrote the authors.\n\n\"The effects of consistent pain management on the development of preprocedural anxiety (fear), hypersensitivity to pain and compliance with future vaccination warrant future investigation,\" they recommend.\n\n###\n\nThe study was conducted by researchers at SickKids, the University of Toronto, York University and several Toronto-based pediatricians.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-climate-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-cancer-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/AAAS-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/e4/brand.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-audio.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/ACSMeeting.201608.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/portal-marine-new.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/meganav/browse-images.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-12/cmaj-acb120616.php", "title": "Anesthetic cream best for relieving vaccination pain in infants", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "For babies under age one year, lidocaine cream, combined with a small amount of sugar given by mouth and infant soothing, can help relieve pain from routine vaccinations, according to a study in Canadian Medical Association Journal.", "keywords": "Medicine/Health, Clinical Trials, Vaccines, Pain, Pediatrics", "date": "Mon, 12 Dec 2016 05:00:00 GMT", "funder": "Pfizer/Investigator Initiated Research", "journal": "Canadian Medical Association Journal", "type": "research", "institution": "Canadian Medical Association Journal", "region": "namerica", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@EurekAlert", "creator": "CMAJ", "domain": "www.eurekalert.org", "title": "Anesthetic cream best for relieving vaccination pain in infants", "description": "For babies under age one year, lidocaine cream, combined with a small amount of sugar given by mouth and infant soothing, can help relieve pain from routine vaccinations, according to a study in Canadian Medical Association Journal."}, "og": {"title": "Anesthetic cream best for relieving vaccination pain in infants", "description": "For babies under age one year, lidocaine cream, combined with a small amount of sugar given by mouth and infant soothing, can help relieve pain from routine vaccinations, according to a study in Canadian Medical Association Journal.", "site_name": "EurekAlert!", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003/https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-12/cmaj-acb120616.php", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161213112003im_/https://www.eurekalert.org/images/EurekAlert_StackedLogo_RGB.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"profile_id": "CMAJ.JAMC"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1482987600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
