It is already well-established that the benefit of clot removal declines each hour during the first 6 hours after symptoms are detected.\n\nIn the current analysis of treatment between 6 and 24 hours after symptoms were observed, or after the person was last seen to be well, researchers found:\n\neach 1-hour delay reduces the chance of recovery with minimal or no disability by 11 percent; and\n\ntreatment remains beneficial through 24 hours, with patients who had their clots removed being 35.5 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability 90 days later, but the overall effect of treatment declines with time.\n\nThe current results demonstrate the importance of prompt imaging and treatment of patients with clot-caused stroke, even in those who wake up having experienced a stroke or who for other reasons are not identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms.\n\n###\n\nStryker Neuroendovascular funded the DAWN Trial.\n\nRaul G.
