Research presented today at the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine\u2019s (AOSSM) Annual Meeting in Colorado Springs, CO, demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.\n\nThe study examined 121 patients at an average of 51 months post-surgery. Of this group, 68 patients had experienced their first dislocation, while 53 had recurrent dislocations after being initially treated non-operatively. After treatment with an arthroscopic bankart repair, the postoperative dislocation rate in the first-time injury group was 29%, compared to 62% in those who did not have surgery after their initial injury. The average age of patients was 19 years old.\n\n\u201cDeciding between a non-operative program or going forward with surgery can be a challenging decision for medical professionals treating shoulder injuries in young athletes,\u201d noted the study\u2019s lead author Tyler J. Marshall, MD, from Alabama Ortho Spine and Sports in Birmingham, AL. \u201cHowever, this study shows a substantial benefit for athletes undergoing surgery to prevent recurrent instability down the road.\u201d\n\nThe research data was collected between 2003 and 2013 from eight fellowship trained surgical practices, with patient ages ranging from 16 to 30 years old. Surveys given to patients during follow-ups asked for information such as test for shoulder functionality, whether patients returned to sport, postoperative instability events, and if further surgery was required on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cWhile young athletes and parents may be wary of surgery, our study shows the advantages of this treatment approach,\u201d commented Marshall. \u201cPhysicians should counsel those with first time injuries on these benefits moving forward.\u201d\n\n###\n\nThe American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) is a global leader in orthopaedic sports medicine education, research, communication and fellowship, and includes national and international sports medicine leaders.
