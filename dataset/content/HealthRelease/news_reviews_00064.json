Results from MERCURY PE, which evaluated the benefits of treating patients with low-risk PE with XARELTO\u00ae and discharging them early from the emergency department to complete treatment at home, were published in Academic Emergency Medicine.\n\nClick to Tweet: New study shows out-patient use of Janssen #bloodthinner results in cost savings and reduces time in hospital for low-risk PE patients https://ctt.ac/RZ2ka+\n\n\"Every year, U.S. health care systems spend more than two billion dollars to manage patients with pulmonary emboli,\" said principal study investigator W. Frank Peacock, MD, FACEP, FACC, Associate Chair and Research Director, Emergency Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. \"By avoiding hospitalizations that are not clinically necessary and transitioning patients with low-risk PE to out-patient treatment with XARELTO\u00ae, we've seen significant cost savings, which could help alleviate the burden on health care systems.\"\n\n\n\nVenous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a deep vein, and PE, a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot travels to the lung. Of the approximately 900,000 Americans who experience a VTE each yeari, more than 250,000 are diagnosed with PE in the emergency departmentii. Hospitals across the United States have varying protocols for managing PE, but standard of care typically requires people to be admitted for treatment, which drives up costs and substantially increases hospital-acquired conditions and infectionsiii,iv. While people with more severe PE have higher mortality rates, the 30-day mortality rate of low-risk PE is less than one percentv.\n\nClick to Tweet: Patients taking Janssen blood thinner say in a new study that out-patient treatment is less burdensome than the standard of care https://ctt.ac/W41cS+\n\nMERCURY PE met its primary efficacy endpoint, with XARELTO\u00ae leading to significantly reduced time in the hospital due to VTE or bleeding within 30 days after randomization compared with the standard of care (mean duration of 4.8 vs. 33.6 hours, respectively; 95% CI; p<0.0001). The mean difference of length of stay between the two groups was 28.8 hours. Of note, there was no recurrence of VTE or VTE-related death or any significant differences in the bleeding-related hospitalizations or physician visits within 90 days from randomization in either group, though this outcome should be interpreted with caution, as the study was significantly underpowered to detect any such differences.\n\n\"We're proud to have pioneered this groundbreaking research, which was the first prospective randomized trial to confirm the benefit of discharging patients with low-risk PE early from the hospital and completing treatment at home,\" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. \"We expect that this XARELTO\u00ae study will prompt physicians to reconsider how patients with low-risk PE are managed.\"\n\nAbout MERCURY-PE\n\nPatients with low-risk PE were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to open label XARELTO\u00ae or standard of care within 12 hours of diagnosis. Patients randomized to XARELTO\u00ae were discharged from the emergency department within 24 hours and were instructed to take XARELTO\u00ae 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then XARELTO\u00ae 20 mg once daily until the study was completed. Patients randomized to standard of care were treated per local hospital protocol, which could include hospitalization and any U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anticoagulant strategy, including XARELTO\u00ae.\n\nResearchers also made the following observations about XARELTO\u00ae in this setting:\n\nThe mean length of initial and subsequent hospitalizations for any reason was shorter for patients who were discharged early on XARELTO \u00ae within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively).\n\nwithin 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively). There was no major bleeding in either group within 90 days from randomization, although two patients reported clinically relevant non-major bleeding, one in each group. There were no deaths due to bleeding in the study.\n\nOverall, early discharge on XARELTO\u00ae was markedly less expensive than standard of care. The cost associated with the emergency room visit and any subsequent hospitalization at the time of PE diagnosis and the total costs were $2,638 (p<0.001) and $2,496 (p<0.001) less with XARELTO\u00ae.\n\nMERCURY PE builds on prior research, including a June 2015 study published in Academic Emergency Medicine showing that 106 patients with low-risk PE or DVT, when prescribed XARELTO\u00ae and immediately discharged, had no recurrent events while on therapy. Additionally, no major or clinically relevant bleeding events were observed. A companion study found patients with low-risk PE or DVT who were prescribed XARELTO\u00ae had significantly lower medical costs than those admitted and given standard treatment.\n\nThe clinical and economic benefits demonstrated in the MERCURY-PE trial have been confirmed in more than 3,100 U.S. patients in a real-world study, showing that XARELTO\u00ae resulted in a significant one-day reduction in hospital length of stay and significantly lower total healthcare costs (approximately $2,000).\n\nMERCURY PE Patient Satisfaction Results\n\nPatient satisfaction, both with out-patient and in-patient care, was also analyzed using Likert scales and the Anti-Clot Treatment Score (ACTS). On the Likert scales, most patients in both groups indicated they were \"very satisfied\" with their care, but numerically more patients taking XARELTO\u00ae preferred to receive outpatient care (50 percent) compared to slightly less than half of patients receiving in-patient standard of care (47.5 percent). The ACTS measured the patient's perspective on the burden of treatment, with more patients taking XARELTO\u00ae reporting it was \"not at all\" burdensome compared to those receiving standard of care (64.4 percent vs. 54.4 percent).\n\nAbout MERCURY PE\n\nMERCURY PE was a randomized, open label, parallel-group, multicenter trial conducted at 35 hospitals across the U.S. Adult patients who arrived at the emergency department with confirmed, low-risk PE (defined by the absence of any Hestia criteria) were eligible for enrollment. Of the 114 patients randomized, 99 completed the study (44 in the XARELTO\u00ae group and 55 in the standard of care group). Patients who did not complete the study were mainly lost to follow-up or adverse events. Analyses were conducted by intention-to-treat basis, regardless of the anticoagulant used.\n\nThe primary efficacy outcome was the total amount of time spent in the hospital (in hours) for VTE or bleeding events in the 30 days after randomization. Hospital readmissions for reasons unrelated to VTE were excluded. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding within 90 days. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 90-day rates of new/recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, unplanned hospital or physician office visits for VTE or bleeding, total length of initial or subsequent hospitalizations for any reason, patient-reported satisfaction, and total costs of care. A secondary safety endpoint was clinically relevant non-major bleeding based on International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions.\n\nMERCURY PE also had a few limitations, including sample size (study enrolled 114 of a planned 300 patients), exclusion bias based on subjective evaluation of hemodynamic stability and ability to adhere to protocol, and potential bias due to inability to blind patients to their admission status.\n\nAbout EXPLORER\n\nMERCURY PE is part of the EXPLORER program, which is unmatched by any oral anticoagulant in the Factor Xa inhibitor class in its size, scope and ambition. A collaborative effort between Janssen and its development partner Bayer, EXPLORER seeks to generate important clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of XARELTO\u00ae and its potential role in addressing critical unmet medical needs. A number of the studies in the program are designed to seek additional indications or expand the label for XARELTO\u00ae to benefit more patients in need of additional therapies for their cardiovascular disease. By the time of its completion, more than 275,000 patients will have participated in the EXPLORER clinical development program, other completed and ongoing clinical trials, investigative registries and non-interventional studies.\n\nWHAT IS XARELTO\u00ae?\n\nXARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO\u00ae and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nWhat is the most important information I should know about XARELTO\u00ae (rivaroxaban)?\n\nFor people taking XARELTO\u00ae for atrial fibrillation:\n\nPeople with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO\u00ae lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO\u00ae, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.\n\nDo not stop taking XARELTO\u00ae without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO\u00ae increases your risk of having a stroke.\n\nIf you have to stop taking XARELTO\u00ae, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.\n\nXARELTO\u00ae can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO\u00ae is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO\u00ae you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.\n\nYou may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO\u00ae and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:\n\nAspirin or aspirin-containing products\n\n\n\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\n\n\n\nWarfarin sodium (Coumadin \u00ae , Jantoven \u00ae )\n\n, Jantoven )\n\nAny medicine that contains heparin\n\n\n\nClopidogrel (Plavix \u00ae )\n\n)\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)\n\n\n\nOther medicines to prevent or treat blood clots\n\nTell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.\n\nCall your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:\n\nUnexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:\n\nNosebleeds that happen often\n\n\n\nUnusual bleeding from gums\n\n\n\nMenstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding\n\nBleeding that is severe or you cannot control\n\nRed, pink, or brown urine\n\nBright red or black stools (looks like tar)\n\nCough up blood or blood clots\n\nVomit blood or your vomit looks like \"coffee grounds\"\n\nHeadaches, feeling dizzy or weak\n\nPain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites\n\nSpinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma): People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO \u00ae , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis).
