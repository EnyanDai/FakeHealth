Jensen, MD, of the University of Chicago Medical Center, tells WebMD.\n\n\u201cTriple-drug therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of hepatitis C for patients,\u201d he says.\n\nResults from two phase III boceprevir trials are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.", "images":
