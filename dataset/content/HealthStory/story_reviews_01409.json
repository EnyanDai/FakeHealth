The drug is associated with some serious side effects.\n\nGout occurs when uric acid builds up in the body and forms crystals in the joints or in soft tissue. The crystals cause swelling, redness, pain, and stiffness in the joints. The condition is associated with obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Gout is more common among men and postmenopausal women, and people with kidney disease.\n\nKrystexxa, which is made by Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. of East Brunswick, N.J., is an enzyme that lowers uric acid levels by metabolizing it into a chemical that does not cause bodily damage and is then passed through the urine.\n\nThe drug is administered to patients every two weeks as an intravenous infusion.\n\nTwo six-month clinical trials of 212 total patients showed that the drug lowered uric acid levels and reduced deposits of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissue. Savient expects Krystexxa to be available by prescription later this year.", "images":
