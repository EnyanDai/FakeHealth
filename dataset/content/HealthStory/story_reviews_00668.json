But the influence of cognitive decline on how sexuality is perceived in later life wasn\u2019t known, researchers said.\n\nThe study, conducted in the Netherlands, involved 1,747 men and women from a larger study of aging. The subjects were 71 years old, on average. About three-quarters had partners. Researchers assessed cognitive function with tests of memory, mental processing speed, general cognitive function and fluid intelligence, or the ability to reason and think abstractly.\n\nSubjects responded to four questions about the importance of sexuality personally and to older people generally, and about their current sex life and need for intimacy and touching with aging. Chronic diseases, depression and medications were recorded.\n\nA quarter of the subjects rated their current or personal sexuality as important or very important, while 41% rated it as unimportant. Nearly 28% agreed that sexuality at an older age isn\u2019t important anymore; 42% felt it was important.\n\nCurrent sexual activity was considered pleasant and unpleasant by 32% and 6%, respectively, but 67% believed intimacy and touching are still needed in older people, while 12% didn\u2019t agree.\n\nSubjects who didn\u2019t see the importance of sexual behavior or a need for intimacy, and who considered their current sexuality unimportant and their sex life unpleasant, had lower average cognitive scores compared with those who felt sexuality was important and were satisfied with their current sexual activity. The association between lower cognitive functioning and the belief that sexuality was unimportant was significant in both sexes, but seemed stronger in women, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The study didn't include subjects with severe cognitive impairment. Causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldn\u2019t be determined.\n\nThe Perception of Sexuality in Older Adults and Its Relationship with Cognitive Functioning\n\nRunning injuries: Regular shoe changes\u2014and playing different sports\u2014may reduce the risk of injury in recreational runners, suggests a study in the current issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports.\n\nRunning involves the repetition of a large number of almost identical movements with very few variations, which can lead to overuse injuries, researchers said. Alternating shoes and sports may help to vary the musculoskeletal load, the study suggests.\n\nIn 2012, researchers in Luxembourg recruited 264 recreational runners, 69 women and 195 men in their early 40s, for the 22-week study. More than half, 56%, alternated approximately four pairs of running shoes of different makes or models, on average, while 44% mostly wore the same pair.\n\nThe subjects used an electronic database to record their weekly running and other sports activities, including the type of activity, duration, intensity, distance and shoe use. Pain in the lower back or legs that developed during exercise and prevented normal activity was recorded, along with the day the sport was resumed.\n\nA third of participants reported at least one running-related injury during the study. Most of the injuries affected muscles and tendons and 36% lasted up to a month or longer.\n\nRunners who wore more than one pair of shoes had a 39% lower risk of injury than those who wore the same pair during almost all running sessions, the adjusted results showed. Multiple shoe users wore the main pair 58% of the time during the study period, while other runners wore the same shoes 91% of the time.\n\nRunners with multiple shoes participated in other sports for close to two hours a week, about twice the amount of time spent by single-shoe runners, and were more regular in their training and experienced in competitions.\n\nCaveat: The study was relatively short, which may have limited the number of reported injuries, researchers said.\n\nCan parallel use of different running shoes decrease running-related injury risk?\n\nResponse shift: People treated for chronic hand eczema may take a rosier view of the disease after it improves, playing down the severity of their worst outbreak, a study found. This change in perception, called a response shift, could adversely affect the behaviors patients use to manage the disease, according to a report in the March issue of Contact Dermatitis.\n\nA response shift is particularly important in clinical studies, as it may result in flawed reporting of treatment effects, the study said. Taking regular photographs of skin areas affected by eczema could help counteract a response shift by patients, researchers suggest.\n\nEczema affects an estimated 10.2% of U.S. adults, according to the National Eczema Association, a nonprofit research organization. Hand eczema is a fluctuating disease that has been shown to seriously affect patients\u2019 quality of life, the study said.\n\nResearchers in Denmark recruited 224 patients with hand eczema, 145 women and 79 men ages 18 to 70. Quality of life and eczema severity were assessed with two questionnaires six months apart. Subjects rated the severity of their current eczema and their worst outbreak on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extremely bad) at both time points.\n\nClose to two-thirds, 61.2%, rated their current eczema lower on the second assessment, at 3.5, on average, compared with 4.7 on the first assessment, indicating an improvement, researchers said. Eczema was unchanged or worse in 38.8%. But 49.1% of subjects rated their worst-ever eczema outbreak at 8, on average, at the second assessment and 8.5 on the first, a statistically significant change that indicated a response shift, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The six-month follow-up period was relatively short, researchers said.\n\nResponse shift in severity assessment of hand eczema with visual analogue scales", "images":
