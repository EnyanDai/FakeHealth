It aims to screen 1,700 men for five years, but results from the first 300 men were published in the British Journal of Urology International.\n\nGenetic factors that increase prostate cancer risk include inheritable variations in genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills 254,000 men a year. U.S. doctors routinely recommend PSA screening in men over 50 on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than doing nothing.\n\nBut fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.\n\nThe men in this study \u2014 205 with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 95 who had tested negative for the mutations \u2014 were all offered annual PSA blood testing, and 24 who had raised PSA levels were given a follow-up biopsy.\n\nEeles said the findings added to the increasing evidence that BRCA gene variation carriers develop more aggressive disease and supported the idea that men with genetic risks should be routinely screened for prostate cancer.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-idUSTRE6885QP20100909", "title": "Study backs prostate screening for high risk men", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews;USWire_EL", "description": "Men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prostate cancer may benefit from regular screening for the disease, a study by British scientists found Friday.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "Britain,United States,Sonya Hepinstall,Kate Kelland,Ros Eeles,US,CANCER,PROSTATE", "news_keywords": "Britain;United States;Sonya Hepinstall;Kate Kelland;Ros Eeles;US;CANCER;PROSTATE", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Sep 09 23:03:14 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-09-09T23:03:14+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-idUSTRE6885QP20100909", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Study backs prostate screening for high risk men", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Britain,United States,Sonya Hepinstall,Kate Kelland,Ros Eeles,US,CANCER,PROSTATE", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-PROSTATE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Study backs prostate screening for high risk men", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2010-09-09T23:03:14+0000", "sailthru.title": "Study backs prostate screening for high risk men", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Study backs prostate screening for high risk men", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-idUSTRE6885QP20100909", "type": "article", "description": "Men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prosta...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-09-09T23:03:14+0000", "modified_time": "2010-09-09T23:03:14+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "Britain,United States,Sonya Hepinstall,Kate Kelland,Ros Eeles,US,CANCER,PROSTATE"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Study backs prostate screening for high risk men", "description": "Men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prostate cancer may benefit from regular screening for the disease, a study by British scientists found Friday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
