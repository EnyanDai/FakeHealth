Botox injections are also used, often in cases where the medicine does not work.\n\nNow a placebo-controlled study has found that the treatments are equally useful in reducing the frequency of episodes of incontinence, but vary in side effects and long-term effectiveness.\n\nResearchers randomly assigned 241 women with urinary incontinence to daily medicine and a placebo injection, or a Botox injection and a daily placebo pill.\n\nThe scientists, writing online on Oct. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that both treatments significantly reduced incontinence episodes. Dry mouth was much more common in those who took the medicine; urinary infections and incomplete emptying of the bladder were more common in those given Botox. Significantly, those who took Botox were more likely to have their symptoms completely disappear.\n\nThe medicine has to be taken daily, while Botox is given in a single injection that is effective for about 6 to 12 months.\n\n\u201cThese are both effective treatments,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Anthony G. Visco, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke. \u201cThis gives patients the information to make an informed decision. Both are reasonable options.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-regimens/well-regimens-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/marketing/newsletters/images/Running_75.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/well/well_post.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-regimens/well-regimens-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-articleInline.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-regimens/well-regimens-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Bakalar"], "canonical_link": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/options-in-treating-incontinence/", "title": "Options in Treating Incontinence", "meta_data": {"communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/Options in Treating Incontinence", "communityAssetURL": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/options-in-treating-incontinence/", "PT": "Blogs", "PST": "Blog Post", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000001846092, "author": "Nicholas Bakalar", "CLMST": "Nicholas Bakalar", "byl": "Nicholas Bakalar", "GBLC": "Featured", "PUV": "normal", "article": {"published_time": 1350325760, "modified_time": "2012-10-15T18:29:20-04:00", "section": "Health", "tag": "Featured", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp"}, "PUD": 20121015, "pdate": 20121015, "ptime": 20121015142920, "utime": 20121015182920, "DISPLAYDATE": "October 15, 2012", "dat": "October 15, 2012", "CG": "Health", "SCG": "well", "BN": "well", "robots": "noodp", "des": "Botox (Drug);Incontinence;Medicine and Health", "keywords": "Botox (Drug),Incontinence,Medicine and Health,Featured", "description": "Anticholinergic medicine and Botox injections are equally effective in reducing episodes, a study shows, with those who took Botox more likely to see symptoms completely disappear.", "hdl_p": "Vital Signs | Regimens: Options in Treating Incontinence", "hdl": "Options in Treating Incontinence", "og": {"title": "Options in Treating Incontinence", "type": "article", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/options-in-treating-incontinence/", "site_name": "Well", "description": "Anticholinergic medicine and Botox injections are equally effective in reducing episodes, a study shows, with those who took Botox more likely to see symptoms completely disappear.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-regimens/well-regimens-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"}, "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-regimens/well-regimens-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Options in Treating Incontinence", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/options-in-treating-incontinence/", "description": "Anticholinergic medicine and Botox injections are equally effective in reducing episodes, a study shows, with those who took Botox more likely to see symptoms completely disappear.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-regimens/well-regimens-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "site": "@nytimeswell"}, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/26/health/well-regimens/well-regimens-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1350273600.0, "source": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
