Carlesimo, MD, PhD, of Italy's Tor Vergata University tells WebMD.\n\nIn a study published in the Jan. 19 issue of Neurology, Carlesimo and colleagues found that DTI scanning predicted declines in memory performance with more accuracy than traditional MRI.\n\n\"This type of brain scan appears to be a better way to measure how healthy the brain is in people who are experiencing memory loss,\" Carlesimo says in a news release. \"This might help doctors when trying to differentiate between normal aging and diseases like Alzheimer's.\"", "images":
