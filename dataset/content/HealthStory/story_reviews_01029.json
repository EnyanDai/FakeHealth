Some European hospitals already rely on the method, called cell-free fetal DNA, although it\u2019s not available from doctors in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWhat they are finding in England is that many women are not going on to have the invasive tests,\u201d Bianchi told Reuters Health.\n\nIn those procedures, doctors either extract a small amount of the fluid that surrounds the fetus (amniocentesis) or they take a sample of the placenta (chorionic villus sampling). Between one in 100 and one in 600 mothers miscarry as a result, according to Bianchi.\n\nIn a fresh look at the medical evidence for the blood test, she and her colleagues analyzed 57 earlier studies that included more than 6,500 pregnancies.\n\nThey found parents could trust the test 98.8 percent of the time when it said they\u2019d have a boy, and 94.8 percent of the time when it indicated a girl.\n\nThat leaves some room for error, which could be important if parents are making medical decisions based on the results \u2014 such as whether or not to get an invasive procedure to look for genetic disorders.\n\nHowever, the current non-invasive alternative \u2014 an ultrasound done at the end of the first trimester \u2014 isn\u2019t always good at spotting a baby\u2019s sex, Bianchi\u2019s team reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nAnd the blood test is reliable as early as seven weeks into the pregnancy, whereas ultrasound is not.\n\nBianchi said one study had estimated the blood test costs about 255 pounds in the UK (about $413), all included. While it\u2019s available over the Internet, she said her team had only looked at hospital-based test performance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why it is not being incorporated in the US,\u201d she said.\n\nRosser, however, chalked that up to the ethical issues it raises.\n\n\u201cIt is a great test that can be part of our armamentarium of noninvasive testing that we use,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it should only be used by families that are at risk for sex-linked diseases.\u201d\n\nBianchi said she owns stock in Verinata Health, a company that is developing cell-free fetal DNA tests for Down syndrome, although that company had no role in the new study.\n\nThe American College of Medical Genetics did not respond to requests for comment on the DNA tests.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/4HWZ7 Journal of the American Medical Association, August 10, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mothers-blood-test-idUSTRE77860Q20110809", "title": "Mother's blood test reveals baby's sex", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Blood drawn from expectant mothers could offer parents an earlier sneak peek at their baby's sex than methods currently used in the U.S., researchers said Tuesday.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "US,MOTHERS,BLOOD,TEST", "news_keywords": "US;MOTHERS;BLOOD;TEST", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Aug 09 21:37:45 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-08-09T21:37:45+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mothers-blood-test-idUSTRE77860Q20110809", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Mother's blood test reveals baby's sex", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,MOTHERS,BLOOD,TEST", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-MOTHERS-BLOOD-TEST", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Mother's blood test reveals baby's sex", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2011-08-09T21:37:45+0000", "sailthru.title": "Mother's blood test reveals baby's sex", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Mother's blood test reveals baby's sex", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mothers-blood-test-idUSTRE77860Q20110809", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Blood drawn from expectant mothers could offer parents an ear...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-08-09T21:37:45+0000", "modified_time": "2011-08-09T21:37:45+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "US,MOTHERS,BLOOD,TEST"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Mother's blood test reveals baby's sex", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Blood drawn from expectant mothers could offer parents an earlier sneak peek at their baby's sex than methods currently used in the U.S., researchers said Tuesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1312862400.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
