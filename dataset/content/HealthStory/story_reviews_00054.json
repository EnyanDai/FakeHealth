Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cTaking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.\n\nPoor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nTo investigate, Zheng\u2019s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.\n\nOver the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person\u2019s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.\n\nWhile the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn\u2019t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.\n\nShe recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.\n\n\u201cThis study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,\u201d said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,\u201d she said in a phone interview.\n\nThe good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration \u201care highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they\u2019re detected early.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2KNE36Y and bit.ly/2KKPqfN JAMA Ophthalmology, online June 28, 2018.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anne Harding", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cognition-vision-idUSKBN1JU2M1", "title": "Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) -\u00a0 Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in older people, suggests a U.S. study.", "Author": "Anne Harding", "keywords": "US,HEALTH,COGNITION,VISION,Geriatrics / Ageing,Health / Medicine,Dementia,Mental Illness,Clinical Medicine,Psychology,Ophthalmological Disorders,Neurological Disorders", "news_keywords": "US;HEALTH;COGNITION;VISION;Geriatrics / Ageing;Health / Medicine;Dementia;Mental Illness;Clinical Medicine;Psychology;Ophthalmological Disorders;Neurological Disorders", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Jul 04 18:34:47 UTC 2018", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2018-07-04T18:34:47+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Anne Harding", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cognition-vision-idUSKBN1JU2M1", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,HEALTH,COGNITION,VISION,Geriatrics / Ageing,Health / Medicine,Dementia,Mental Illness,Clinical Medicine,Psychology,Ophthalmological Disorders,Neurological Disorders", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEALTH-COGNITION-VISION", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too", "sailthru.author": "Anne Harding", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-04T18:34:47+0000", "sailthru.title": "Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cognition-vision-idUSKBN1JU2M1", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) -\u00a0 Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in ...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-04T18:34:47+0000", "modified_time": "2018-07-04T18:34:47+0000", "section": "companies-health", "author": "Anne Harding", "tag": "US,HEALTH,COGNITION,VISION,Geriatrics / Ageing,Health / Medicine,Dementia,Mental Illness,Clinical Medicine,Psychology,Ophthalmological Disorders,Neurological Disorders"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too", "description": "(Reuters Health) -\u00a0 Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in older people, suggests a U.S. study.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "companies-health - phar-code", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "companies-health", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "phar-code", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530729287.0, "source": "https://www.reuters.com", "summary": ""}
