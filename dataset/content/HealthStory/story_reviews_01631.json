But, she added, because this is the first study of its kind, and the acupuncture protocol used was specifically designed for this study, \"you always need replication of the findings.\"\n\nDr. Shari Lusskin, director of reproductive psychiatry at the New York University Langone Medical Center, echoed that sentiment. \"It's encouraging to see alternative treatments being studied in a scientific manner, and this study should generate further studies. It needs to be replicated on a larger scale,\" she noted.\n\n\"This is one treatment, and perhaps it will become another possible treatment tool in our therapeutic toolbox,\" said Lusskin. But, she cautioned that \"acupuncture is not a substitute for the appropriate use of antidepressant therapy especially in women with a prior history of response to antidepressants.\"\n\nAs many as 20 percent of women may experience depression during pregnancy, according to the March of Dimes. Symptoms include sad, hopeless feelings that persist, generally for more than two weeks, Lusskin said. Women may also experience severe anxiety or feel disconnected from the baby. And, she cautioned, suicidal thoughts are never normal and are a sign that you should seek help.\n\nMany women are cautious about using medications during pregnancy, reports the study. Interpersonal psychotherapy is an option for women who are depressed during pregnancy, but this type of therapy isn't always available, according to the study.\n\nFor the study, Manber and her colleagues recruited 150 pregnant women who were diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. All were between 12 and 30 weeks of gestation.\n\nThe women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: depression-specific acupuncture (52 women), control acupuncture (49 women) or massage (49 women). The depression-specific protocol was designed just for this study, and the control acupuncture was specifically designed to avoid using acupuncture needles in any areas known to affect depression.\n\nThe treatments lasted for eight weeks. Women received treatment twice a week for the first four weeks, and then once a week for the next four weeks. The treatments lasted an average of 25 minutes.\n\nThe researchers found a 63 percent response rate in women who received the depression-specific acupuncture, while the response rate was 44.3 percent in the control acupuncture and massage groups. A response rate was defined as a 50 percent reduction in depression symptoms, Manber said.\n\nResults of the study are scheduled to be published in the March issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.\n\n\"We found our acupuncture protocol was helpful, but that does not mean that any acupuncture for depression treatment will be effective. The quality of what you get can differ from one practitioner to another,\" said Manber.\n\n\"Our goal is always to find treatments that have the maximum benefits and minimum risk,\" said Lusskin. \"Many women think it's safer for the baby to go off antidepressants, but there's a real risk to the baby for untreated depression in pregnancy. And, we have enough safety data about antidepressant use in pregnancy that we can make informed choices about managing treatment during pregnancy.\"\n\nThe bottom line, she said, is to talk with your doctor to find the right combination of treatments that can help you. \"Depression is not a one-size-fits-all illness, and treatment won't be one-size-fits-all either. If acupuncture ends up being helpful for you, that's great, but make sure you're treated into remission.\"\n\nMore information\n\nTo learn more about depression during and after pregnancy, visit the National Women's Health Information Center.", "images": ["http://Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "http://Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Serena Gordon"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/alternative-medicine-information-3/acupuncture-news-5/acupuncture-may-ease-depression-during-pregnancy-636244.html", "title": "Acupuncture May Ease Depression During Pregnancy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "In study, response rate almost 20 percent higher with depression-specific acupuncture", "og": {"title": "Acupuncture May Ease Depression During Pregnancy", "description": "In study, response rate almost 20 percent higher with depression-specific acupuncture", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/alternative-medicine-information-3/acupuncture-news-5/acupuncture-may-ease-depression-during-pregnancy-636244.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://Healthday.com", "summary": ""}
