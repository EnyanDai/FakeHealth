By the third week, he said, both he and friends he asked for reactions were seeing results. \u201cI even busted out the old \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a noticeable difference.\u201d\n\nBut Latisse does not appear to be a silver bullet for hair loss. Instead, it appears to work in much the same way as Rogaine or Propecia: All three can strengthen and darken hair that grows from a dying follicle, but none can bring a dead one back to life. The result is an enhanced, refortified hairline rather than a brand new head of hair.\n\nPhoto\n\nAside from hair transplants, which can cost about $10,000 each and do not always look natural, the only current hope for complete replacement is hair cloning, the act of producing entirely new hair from the DNA of an existing one, which researchers have been attempting, unsuccessfully, for years.\n\nA pair of researchers last year claimed to grow new hair by combining plucked hair with a wound-healing powder made by ACell, a regenerative-medicine company in Columbia, Md. Though the claim was met with some skepticism by other clinicians, the idea that ACell\u2019s powder, which has been approved by the government, could facilitate new hair growth has breathed new life into the race to clone hair.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Robert M. Bernstein, clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University, is now one of several researchers experimenting with the product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of time now\u201d before hair cloning becomes a reality, Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cWe keep on moving back that time, but I think there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that it\u2019s going to be done.\u201d\n\nHe believes hair cloning will be commercially available within 10 years. This may sound like a long time to wait, but \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that baldness is unlike other conditions where you can progress past the point of being helped,\u201d Dr. Bernstein said. \u201cOnce we have a cure for hair loss, everyone will be able to benefit.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nIt has been been 14 years since the F.D.A. approved a new hair-loss remedy (Propecia, in 1997), so it is understandable that anticipation for a new one might be running high. One advantage of Latisse is that it needs to be applied only once a day (Rogaine needs to be applied twice; Propecia is taken once daily), and does not seem to cause reactions in people who are allergic to minoxidil.\n\nIt is, however, expensive: a month\u2019s supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes. Rogaine, which is also available over the counter now, costs about $25 a month, and a month\u2019s supply of Propecia runs about $75. (Even Mr. Paduda has now switched to Propecia, citing cost.)\n\nThe potential for Latisse is not lost on Allergan. The company initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in August to determine whether bimatoprost can be used as a treatment in men and women suffering from hair loss (alopecia).\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
