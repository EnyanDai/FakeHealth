Most of those trials were funded and run by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture Prozac and Effexor \u2014 Eli Lilly and Wyeth, respectively.\n\nThey included 12 studies of Prozac in adults and four each in elderly patients and youth, as well as 21 trials of immediate- or extended-release Effexor in adults. About 9,000 participants were included.\n\nMore adults and kids taking Prozac, known generically as fluoxetine, had at least a 50 percent improvement in scores on depression tests after six weeks compared to those assigned to take a placebo pill.\n\nFifty-five percent of adults on Prozac responded to treatment, compared to 34 percent in the placebo group. In youth, 30 percent on Prozac had significant symptom improvement, compared to just six percent of the comparisons.\n\nThe benefits were seen regardless of how severe patients\u2019 symptoms were before starting treatment.\n\nHowever, in the elderly the differences between the treatment and placebo groups were much smaller, and the researchers calculated that 17 older patients would have to be treated with Prozac for one to gain from it.\n\n\u201cClearly the efficacy of antidepressants is age-dependent, (and) largest, most interestingly, in youth, which I don\u2019t think would be the mainstream view in psychiatry,\u201d Gibbons told Reuters Health.\n\nThe findings, he added, \u201craise other questions that need to be followed up (including), what\u2019s going on in the elderly?\u201d\n\nBoth types of Effexor, or venlafaxine, also seemed to help adults with mild to severe depression, with slightly more patients responding to the immediate-release dose.\n\nSome of the study\u2019s authors have testified for or received funding from drug companies, though the report itself was funded by national health agencies.\n\nThe researchers said they couldn\u2019t be sure there would be similar improvements with other types of antidepressants \u2014 especially given the more limited data in kids and the elderly \u2014 or that the longer-term benefits would be as clear.\n\nOne recent study suggested that up to a fifth of patients on the antidepressant Cymbalta (duloxetine) might actually benefit more from placebo pills (see Reuters Health story of December 9, 2011.)\n\nIrving Kirsch, who studies antidepressants and placebos at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the new report didn\u2019t make him more optimistic about the drugs.\n\nIf five or more patients need to be treated with an antidepressant for one to substantially improve, most don\u2019t get much out of it, he pointed out.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 percent of the patients are not getting a significant benefit from the drug \u2014 either they\u2019re not getting better or they would get the same benefit with placebo,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cThere are alternative treatments for depression that also produce about the same symptom reduction as the drugs do, but without the risk of side effects,\u201d Kirsch added, including psychotherapy and exercise.\n\nStill, Gibbons said that the improvement in symptoms for the average patient wasn\u2019t insignificant.\n\n\u201cDefinitely it doesn\u2019t look like antidepressants are placebos,\u201d he concluded.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/AaNJqw Archives of General Psychiatry, online March 5, 2012.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Genevra Pittman", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-study-antidepressants-idUSTRE82623V20120307", "title": "Study suggests overall benefit from antidepressants", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
