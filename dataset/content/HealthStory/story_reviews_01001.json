About 5 million Americans have fibromyalgia.\n\nCyclobenzaprine, marketed in higher doses by others as Amrix, Fexmid, and Flexeril, is already widely used ''off-label'' for patients with fibromyalgia, Lederman says. \"Off-label\" refers to the practice of prescribing medicines to treat conditions not been specifically approved by the FDA.\n\nTONIX is developing a lower-dose version and improving the formula, Lederman says.\n\nHowever, a rheumatologist not connected to the study does not expect the new drug to be a ''game-changer.\"\n\nThe results of the study are published online in The Journal of Rheumatology.", "images":
