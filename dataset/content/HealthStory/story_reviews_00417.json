Sure, I talk to my students about personal responsibility, but when it comes to the health of populations, I look for big fixes more than for small acts of will.\n\nThat\u2019s why my ears perked up when I heard that two old physician friends had decided to start taking, as a preventive measure, some of the medications often included in what the field has dubbed the \u201cpolypill.\u201d My friends are both top doctors in their 60s, with good diet and lifestyle, and this is now part of their personal health regimen.\n\nA polypill might include any of several things: a baby aspirin, a statin to rebalance cholesterol, a drug to control blood pressure and one to lower blood sugar. (A version less comprehensive than this is available online with a doctor\u2019s prescription at Polypill.com.) Whatever the combination, the doses are low, so it\u2019s relatively safe. It\u2019s like a multivitamin, but with serious medications. Some public-health advocates now argue that everyone over 50 should be on one.\n\nYou read that right: everyone. If we had perfectly healthy lifestyles, these drugs would not be needed, but we don\u2019t. And even if we did, the drugs might add further protection.\n\nOne review of the research on polypills comes from Melvin Lafeber and his colleagues at the University Medical Center Utrecht (Netherlands). Writing in Current Hypertension Reports in April, they found reason to think that treatment might help higher-risk individuals and urged more clinical trials. If moderate- and high-risk people benefit, \u201cthe idea of offering treatment to everybody older than 50 years might raise widespread interest,\u201d they wrote. The polypill, they concluded, \u201ccould be an important tool to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease\u201d and make it more likely that patients take the necessary drugs.\n\nCritics worry about medicalizing whole populations, predicting that the pill would encourage bad habits and worsen health disparities. A fixed-dose combination pill is one-size-fits-all, which doctors don\u2019t usually regard as the best medicine. But polypills might solve real problems. The drugs in them are cheap and target illnesses that afflict many millions around the world, and even patients with tailored prescriptions often fail to keep up with the various medicines.\n\nSome of the component drugs are now being evaluated for use with lower-risk populations\u2014that is, people who don\u2019t already have serious problems with their blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol. Though not a polypill experiment per se, a study published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine involved 12,000 people over five years. One group got two drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, the other got placebos. In the group taking both drugs, 3.6% died or had health crises; in the placebo group, 5% did. The doses were low, so the adverse effects were modest.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that we should all be on the polypill, but some sensible experts, including my two doctor friends, are moving toward this sort of preventive approach for people who aren\u2019t ill or at high risk. After all, many of us are already taking low-dose aspirin, which is possibly the riskiest of these drugs.\n\nI tend to favor this sort of blunt, comprehensive approach to public health. Much as I like menacing cigarette-package warnings, urging personal responsibility, I like cigarette taxes more (despite their regressive impact). I love \u201cDrive Carefully\u201d signs, but I like seat belts better. And I like air bags best: No judgment, no decision, no defiant will. As for driving under the influence, breathalyzer tests and taking keys away beat the heck out of admonitions to be sober and find a designated driver.\n\nHuman nature is not our ally in maintaining health. With heart disease and stroke, many millions of lives are at stake, and for me it comes down to this: Will popping a polypill work better than willpower? I suspect that the answer may turn out to be yes.", "images": ["https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-OJ821_MINDMA_P_20160608104907.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125024/social", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/93d4c0693749e5d6abc5f87d798d3bfdb580948b.jpg?5dc995fd", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746?width=111&height=62", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/0d2ffa0d6fff89f02d5a9d5508d5467ad9dbd858.jpg?5dc99f52", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/869c2a340c4c25db5466a6de556da60ae1a2bf4e.jpg?5dc9a205", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125154?width=111&height=62", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-OJ821_MINDMA_D_20160608104907.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/f600b0a56ee84a4d350fa4e522e51ee27d5fd426.jpg?5dc9a19d", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/b5e977a5139ed9e9684742f90919df7b635ae623.jpg?5dc94a1a", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/2a7d0786567f18bb6a72f17019cd642c0b51f730.jpg?5dc9aa57", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/4a581253a775cca47f02b15ba756a5f4ccf7b8bf.jpg?5dc969b8", "https://images.wsj.net/im-124802?width=111&height=62", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-OJ821_MINDMA_TOP_20160608104907.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/fddd6d28f0576a5772474e644a95623747e1cb4b.jpg?5dc9a2a9", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/461b35da8a2936ee4a7ca01072773c0d5aa427f2.jpg?5dc9a214"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-OJ821_MINDMA_TOP_20160608104907.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melvin Konner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-polypill-may-be-the-next-big-preventive-fix-1465406209", "title": "A \u2018Polypill\u2019 May Be the Next Big Preventive Fix", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dj.asn": "i-0fb6", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "page.section": "Article", "page.content.type": "Article", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online", "article.template": "full", "page.site": "wsj", "page.site.product": "WSJ", "page.region": "na,us", "article.id": "SB12671714249199043578504582112561840827538", "article.type": "Mind and Matter: Melvin Konner", "article.type.display": "Mind and Matter: Melvin Konner", "article.access": "free", "article.origheadline": "A \u2018Polypill\u2019 May Be the Next Big Preventive Fix", "article.headline": "A \u2018Polypill\u2019 May Be the Next Big Preventive Fix", "article.summary": "Polypills\u2014at least in one configuration\u2014battle heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses all at the same time.
