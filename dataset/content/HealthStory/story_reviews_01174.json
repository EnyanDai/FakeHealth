Half of them received traditional acupuncture treatment. The rest were treated with \u201csham\u201d acupuncture needles that were blunted and did not penetrate the skin.\n\nA five-point scale was used to measure the severity of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, urinary symptoms, mood swings, and other symptoms in the postmenopausal women.\n\nTwenty-seven women received traditional Chinese acupuncture twice a week for 10 sessions from an experienced and licensed acupuncturist. Those in the comparison group were treated with shams needles at the same acupuncture points.\n\nLevels of estrogen and other hormones were measured before the study and after the first and last acupuncture sessions in both those receiving real and sham treatments.", "images":
