Rising levels of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) are a sign that prostate cancer may be getting worse.\n\nThe men took either one capsule containing 1 gram of pomegranate extract or three pomegranate capsules daily.\n\nAt the start of the study, the men's PSA levels were doubling every 12 months. After six months of taking the capsules, it took 19 months for their PSA levels to double.\n\n\"The results were similar regardless of whether the men took one capsule or three,\" Carducci tells WebMD.\n\nHowever, men who took three pills daily were more likely to suffer mild to moderate diarrhea: 14% vs. 2% of those who took one pill.\n\nCarducci credits antioxidants in the pomegranate for its anticancer effect.\n\nThe study was presented at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.", "images":
