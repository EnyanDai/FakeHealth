Daily intake of dried ginger significantly reduced sneezing and other signs of allergy in rodents with induced allergic rhinitis, or hay fever.\n\nA major component in ginger, 6-gingerol, suppresses the activation of T lymphocytes, or T cells, a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in sensitizing people to specific allergens, the researchers said.\n\nGinger is a popular spice produced from the root of the ginger plant, Zingiber officinale. Some herbal remedies for nausea and other ailments also contain ginger.\n\nExperiments in Japan involved mice fed a normal diet containing 2% powdered ginger or a control diet without ginger. After two weeks on the diets, the ginger-fed mice received two injections of purified egg proteins called ovalbumin (OVA) to stimulate allergic rhinitis symptoms. Control mice received either OVA or placebo injections.\n\nThe mice underwent an immune challenge two weeks later in which a small amount of OVA was inserted into the nose. Allergic symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal rubbing, were counted for the next 10 minutes.\n\nMice in the ginger-fed group sneezed 2.1 times each, on average. This compares with 15.2 sneezes per mouse in the OVA-injected controls and roughly one sneeze in the placebo-injected animals. Fewer nasal rubbing movements were recorded in the ginger-fed mice compared with OVA-injected controls, but not the placebo group.\n\nGinger-fed mice had lower levels of immunoglobulin E, or IgE, a type of allergic antibody, and mast cells, which release chemicals called histamines that cause sneezing and other allergic symptoms, the study showed. T cells stimulate the production of IgE to specific allergens. IgE binds to receptors on mast cells, triggering the release of histamine.\n\nThe study used powdered ginger, the type used in cooking, containing 0.5% 6-gingerol. Previous studies suggest powdered ginger contains higher concentrations of 6-gingerol than fresh ginger, researchers said.\n\nCaveat: The antiallergic effects of ginger may vary with the 6-gingerol content, researchers said. Ginger has not been tested on people with allergic rhinitis.\n\nPrevention of allergic rhinitis by ginger and the molecular basis of immunosuppression by 6-gingerol through T cell inactivation",
