It showed that the test accurately predicts whether a prostate biopsy will reveal cancer in high-risk men.\n\nPCA3 is found only in the prostate. When prostate cells become cancerous, their PCA3 genes go crazy. Prostate cancer cells express up to 100 times more PCA3 RNA than do normal cells.\n\nThe PCA3 test can do things the PSA test can't, says Jack Groskopf, PhD, of Gen-Probe Inc., which manufactures the test and funded the new research.\n\nThe PSA test detects prostate-specific antigen, a protein given off by all prostate cells. If a man has any type of damage to the prostate, his PSA level can go up. \"More often than not, the damage is due to benign (noncancerous) conditions such as enlarged prostate\" -- a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, Groskopf tells WebMD.\n\nThis often triggers unnecessary biopsies and, sometimes, unnecessary surgery.\n\nThe PCA3 test isn\u2019t a replacement for PSA testing. But it improves the ability to diagnose prostate cancer, Groskopf says.", "images":
