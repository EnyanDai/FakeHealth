The long-acting therapy is taken once-daily at bedtime.\n\nAn estimated 90 percent of levodopa-treated patients, about 200,000 people in the United States, suffer from LID, the company said.\n\nFluctuating levels of levodopa result in erratic periods of muscular control and involuntary movements throughout the day, disrupting activity at least half a dozen times a day.\n\nAs Parkinson\u2019s progresses, patients are dyskinetic just after taking levodopa but increasingly exhibit \u201coff time\u201d, or worsening symptoms, as it wears off.\n\nThese patients have little recourse, other than opting for deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure that involves blocking electrical signals from targeted areas in the brain.\n\nWith Gocovri, which targets both dyskinesia and off time, patients will be able to reclaim about 3.6 hours of their day, CEO Gregory Went said in an interview ahead of the decision.\n\nAbout 50,000 people are diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in the United States each year, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe main ingredient of Gocovri, amantadine, has been available in the market as an antiviral drug for several decades.\n\nThe company said the drug is expected to be available in the fourth quarter, and formally launched in January 2018.\n\nAdamas is also testing the drug to treat walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tamara Mathias", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-adamas-pharma-fda-idUSKCN1B42M8", "title": "Adamas Pharma secures approval for Parkinson's dyskinesia drug", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;medical-research;companies-mrch;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had approved Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc's treatment for a side effect caused by a commonly prescribed Parkinson's drug, sending the shares of the drugmaker soaring in after-market trading.", "Author": "Tamara Mathias", "keywords": "United States,Gregory T.
