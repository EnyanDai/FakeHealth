But most lung cancer is diagnosed when the disease is more advanced, leading to lousy overall mortality rates: Just 18 percent of all lung cancer patients survive for five years.\n\nPulmonologists have tried for years to find ways to detect lung cancer earlier. Experiments using ordinary chest X-rays proved disappointing. Then in 2011, researchers running the National Lung Screening Trial, involving 53,454 smokers and former smokers ages 55 to 74, reported encouraging findings: Patients who received a low-dose CT scan annually for three years were 20 percent less likely to die of lung cancer over an average of 6.5 years than those tested with X-rays.\n\nThose results led to the preventive services task force\u2019s endorsement and, eventually, to Medicare\u2019s approval. \u201cWe\u2019re covering evidence-based preventive services for beneficiaries, which will save lives,\u201d Dr. Conway said.\n\nHow many lives? While the overwhelming number of people with lung cancer are or were smokers, most smokers don\u2019t develop lung cancer. So although a 20 percent reduction in mortality sounds impressive, it represents a small number of people.\n\nIn the national trial, those screened with chest X-rays had about a 1.7 percent chance of dying from lung cancer during the study period; in the CT scan group, it was about 1.4 percent.\n\nFor every thousand people screened with a low-dose CT, three fewer died of lung cancer.\n\nLay people struggle to grasp these kinds of numbers. \u201cThey look at me and say, \u2018Doc, just tell me what to do,\u2019 \u201d Dr. Arenberg said. Or they give a how-can-it-hurt shrug and opt in: Maybe they\u2019ll be among the three in 1,000 saved.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/health/11span/11span-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/health/11span/11span-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/health/11span/11span-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paula Span"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/health/on-medicare-and-assessing-the-value-of-lung-cancer-screening.html", "title": "On Medicare and Assessing the Value of Lung Cancer Screening", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-05-08T16:19:51.000Z", "modified": "2015-05-08T16:19:48.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/paula-span", "tag": "Medicine and Health", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003667898, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/b085507b-3c1d-51ee-9fb8-bab626622f00", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/1cebf34936714f74939c9bc608ff16d0", "description": "Even after Medicare has promised to begin covering the test, it will not help everyone who\u2019s eligible, experts warn, and will subject some to harm.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/health/11span/11span-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Paula Span", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/health/11span/11span-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": ",Medicare,Lung cancer,Smoking,Medical test,CT Scan,United States Preventive Services Task Force,Medicine and Health", "pdate": 20150508, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/health/on-medicare-and-assessing-the-value-of-lung-cancer-screening.html", "type": "article", "title": "On Medicare and Assessing the Value of Lung Cancer Screening", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/health/11span/11span-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "Even after Medicare has promised to begin covering the test, it will not help everyone who\u2019s eligible, experts warn, and will subject some to harm."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/health/on-medicare-and-assessing-the-value-of-lung-cancer-screening.html", "title": "On Medicare and Assessing the Value of Lung Cancer Screening", "description": "Even after Medicare has promised to begin covering the test, it will not help everyone who\u2019s eligible, experts warn, and will subject some to harm.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/11/health/11span/11span-articleLarge.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003667898"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "CN": "the-new-old-age", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/health/on-medicare-and-assessing-the-value-of-lung-cancer-screening.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003667898", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/health/on-medicare-and-assessing-the-value-of-lung-cancer-screening.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/12/health/on-medicare-and-assessing-the-value-of-lung-cancer-screening.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1431403200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
