Clark.\n\nDr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a biological psychiatrist at Duke who had helped recruit patients for the study, called the results among \u201c the most highly anticipated data from the entire meeting.\u201d\n\nTo compare the scans with autopsy results, the company scanned the brains of 35 people in hospices who were expected to die within six months. Some had Alzheimer\u2019s and others did not. After the patients died, their brains were shipped to Phoenix, where a pathologist sliced them into about 100 tiny pieces and sent them off for analysis of plaque.\n\nPathologists in Montreal analyzed the brain slices with a computer that counted plaques. Independently, pathologists in Chicago analyzed them the traditional way \u2014 by looking at the brain slices under a microscope and manually counting the microscopic plaques.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Neither the radiologists nor the pathologists knew whether the patients had dementia.\n\nIn 34 of the 35 patients, the PET scan, the pathologists\u2019 report and the computerized pathology report agreed. In one patient who had Alzheimer\u2019s, the pathologist and the radiologist analyzing the scan did not see much plaque, but the computerized analysis of the scan and the two autopsy reports did.\n\nAnd the data showed that the scans were completely accurate in ruling out Alzheimer\u2019s pathology: unlike doctors, they never said people had Alzheimer\u2019s pathology when they did not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, the company scanned the brains of 76 younger people who would not be expected to have plaque in their brains. None did.\n\n\u201cThat was very reassuring,\u201d said Dr. Michael W. Weiner, an Alzheimer\u2019s expert at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nDr. Reisa A. Sperling, an Alzheimer\u2019s expert at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and co-chairwoman of the session where the results were presented, said, \u201cPersonally, I found the data quite convincing.\u201d\n\nDr. Sperling, an investigator on a different AVID study but who is not paid by the company, said the challenge now will be to see whether the scans can accurately predict whether people are developing Alzheimer\u2019s before they have symptoms.\n\nThat is the stage, she said, \u201cwhere we have the best chance of changing the course of the illness.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/health/research/13alzh.html", "title": "New Scan May Spot Alzheimer\u2019s", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1247468431787", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/health/research/13alzh.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/health/research/13alzh.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1247468431787"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/health/research/13alzh.html", "title": "New Scan May Spot Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "Scientists hope that a new brain scanning technique will allow doctors to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s better and aid drug research.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "ginakolata"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "New Scan May Spot Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "Scientists hope that a new brain scanning technique will allow doctors to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s better and aid drug research.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1247468431787, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "New Scan May Spot Alzheimer\u2019s", "pdate": 20100712, "utime": 20141001045100, "ptime": 20100712161150, "DISPLAYDATE": "July 12, 2010", "dat": "July 12, 2010", "lp": "Scientists hope that a new brain scanning technique will allow doctors to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s better and aid drug research.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "13alzh", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-07-12T16:11:50-04:00", "modified": "2014-10-01T04:51:00-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/gina.kolata.1", "tag": "Brain"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/13/health/research/13alzh.html", "type": "article", "title": "New Scan May Spot Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "Scientists hope that a new brain scanning technique will allow doctors to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s better and aid drug research.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Gina Kolata", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By GINA KOLATA", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "research", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Brain", "keywords": "Alzheimer's Disease,Tests and Testing,Memory,Medicine and Health,Brain", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/research", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1278993600.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
