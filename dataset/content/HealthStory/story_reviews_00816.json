Larger studies in many more patients are needed before the drug will be available, though, she says.\n\nThe benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer\u2019s disease research at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nCalled solanezumab, the drug attaches to a protein called beta-amyloid that builds up and clumps together to form sticky plaques that riddle Alzheimer's patients' brains. The drug is designed to prevent those clumps from forming.\n\nOct. 8, 2012 (Boston) -- An experimental Alzheimer \u2019s treatment slowed memory loss by about one-third in people with mild Alzheimer's , offering hope that the drug can alter the course of the progressive disease.\n\n'Encouraging' Results\n\nMaria Carrillo, PhD, a neuroscientist and vice president for medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, calls the results \"encouraging\" and says she hopes development will continue.\n\n\"While [beta-amyloid] is the leading hypothesis of what causes the disease, that has remained unproven. This study may not have hit on everything, and it is not the home run we wanted, but it is the first time we\u2019ve seen cognitive benefit with an amyloid treatment,\" she says.\n\nThe latest results come from a combined analysis of a 1,012-patient study and a 646-patient study, both of which involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWhen the findings of the two studies were looked at individually, patients given solanezumab for 18 months didn\u2019t do better on either a test used to measure patients' symptoms or a measure of how well patients are functioning than patients given a placebo.\n\nCombining the two studies to give them more statistical power showed that patients on solanezumab didn\u2019t lose their memories as quickly as those on placebo.\n\nThe results really became clear when the researchers looked only at those patients with mild, early-stage disease. In the analysis, those given solanezumab had a 34% reduction in memory loss and other mental symptoms compared with those on placebo. There was even a hint that the drug helped to slow the decline in functioning.\n\nAsked if the 34% improvement in cognitive decline is meaningful to a patient, Carrillo said, \"I have a family member with AD. I would be happy with a sustained cognitive benefit for my mother-in-law.\"\n\nThe only side effect that happened more often in people on solanezumab than patients on placebo was chest pain: 1.1% vs. 0.2%.", "images": ["https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/vitamins_alt11_other/110x70_vitamins_alt11_other.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50",
