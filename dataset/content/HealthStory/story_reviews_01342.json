At the same meeting, other researchers reported that they have new clues about how DNA characteristics can help predict colon cancer risk. The research was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research's special conference, Colorectal Cancer: Biology to Therapy.\n\nScreening for Colon Cancer: Back Story ''One in every 17 of us will have colon cancer in our lifetime,\" says David Ahlquist, MD, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who presented his findings on the new colon cancer screening test. Although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the U.S., many adults don't undergo the screenings once they reach age 50 (or earlier for those with a family history), Ahlquist told a news conference. Estimates of how many adults undergo screening vary, but Ahlquist says probably only 40% adhere to the screening schedule over time. One screening test, the colonoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a video camera is inserted to examine the colon, requires dietary restriction and preparation of the colon. Patients must often take time off work and need transportation home from the procedure.", "images":
