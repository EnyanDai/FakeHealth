The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the injectable drug Siliq (broadalumab) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults.\n\nBecause of an association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, Siliq will be sold with a \u201cblack box\u201d warning and should be considered only for patients whose psoriasis has not responded\u2014or has stopped responding\u2014to phototherapy or to other systemic medicines taken orally or via injection.\n\nPlaque psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes cells to build up on the surface of the skin, forming thick red patches and flaky silver-white scales. Current treatment options for psoriasis include topical treatments (like corticosteroids) phototherapy (using an ultraviolet light box or a laser) and systemic drugs\u2014delivered via a pill, an injection or an IV infusion\u2014that work throughout the body.\n\nSiliq is unique because it binds to the receptor of a protein called interleukin-17, a known contributor to inflammation. By blocking the receptor from being activated, it keeps the body from receiving signals that can fuel inflammatory responses and psoriasis progression. Two other psoriasis drugs currently on the market work similarly, but instead bind to the protein itself.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

(Fried says he has no involvement with the drug or the drug company.)\n\nIn the three clinical trials considered for drug approval, more than 50% of patients who used Siliq achieved total skin clearance\u2014the ultimate goal of psoriasis treatments\u2014within a year. The most common side effects of the drug were joint and muscle pain, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain, nausea, flu, low white blood cell count, fungal infections and reactions at the injection site.\n\nThe drug also comes with a more serious warning, as well. In a total of six clinical trials totaling about 6,200 participants, six suicides were reported by people receiving Siliq. People with a history of suicide attempts or depression had an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

In order to prescribe it, doctors must be certified with the program and must counsel patients about this risk. Patients must also agree to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening mood changes, anxiety or suicidal thoughts.\n\nA causal association between Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. Fried, a dermatologist and clinical psychologist, points out that psoriasis itself can be associated with mental health problems.\n\n\u201cEffective treatment has consistently shown reduction in the incidence and severity of depression and reduced likelihood of suicide,\u201d says Fried. He adds that the data on Siliq suggests that it is not only effective in treating psoriasis, but that many patients experience improvement in anxiety and depression, as well.\n\nSiliq, like other psoriasis medications, also affects the immune system. It can raise patients\u2019 risk of infections and shouldn\u2019t be used by people with certain chronic conditions, such as Crohn\u2019s disease or active tuberculosis infections. People should also avoid immunizations with live vaccines while being treated with Siliq.\n\n\u201cPatients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment,\u201d said Dr. Julie Beitz, director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in an agency press release.\n\nThe drug\u2019s recommended dosage schedule is an injection once a week for the first three weeks, followed by an injection every other week. Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Siliq\u2019s manufacturer, says that pricing information is not available at this time, and expects to begin sales and marketing in the second half of 2017.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/electrocardiogram.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/skin-arm.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/kidney-swaps-organ-donation.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/skin-arm.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/skin-arm.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Macmillan"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4673630/new-psoriasis-drug-siliq/", "title": "How a New Psoriasis Drug Is Different From Others", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "medicine", "news_keywords": "psoriasis, broadalumab, Siliq, biologics, injectable, injection, autoimmunity, interleukin-17", "description": "Siliq, a new psoriasis drug that targets inflammatory protein interleukin-17, was approved by the FDA.", "og": {"title": "How a New Psoriasis Drug Is Different From Others", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4673630/new-psoriasis-drug-siliq/", "description": "Siliq, a new psoriasis drug that targets inflammatory protein interleukin-17, was approved by the FDA.", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/skin-arm.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4673630/new-psoriasis-drug-siliq/", "description": "Siliq, a new psoriasis drug that targets inflammatory protein interleukin-17, was approved by the FDA.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/skin-arm.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4673630/new-psoriasis-drug-siliq/", "title": "How a New Psoriasis Drug Is Different From Others", "description": "Siliq, a new psoriasis drug that targets inflammatory protein interleukin-17, was approved by the FDA.", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/skin-arm.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
