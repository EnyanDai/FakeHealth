It's a Trojan horse approach, where Herceptin homes in on cancer cells and delivers the cancer-killing agent directly to its target.\n\nTumors shrank in one-third of women with metastatic breast cancer given T-DM1, says Ian Krop, MD, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. In another 12%, tumors stopped growing for at least six months.\n\nThe women remained cancer-free for an average of seven months -- results unheard of in patients this sick, he says.\n\nAll the women, who had breast tumors for an average of three years, had cancer that had metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body. They had been treated with an average of seven different therapies, including Herceptin, Tykerb, and Xeloda, and each had failed.\n\n\"This is the first study looking at women who have failed so many other treatments,\" Krop tells WebMD. \"But we think these results are as good as we've ever seen is such a refractory [sick] population,\" he says.\n\nThe findings were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.", "images":
