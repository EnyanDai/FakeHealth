But researchers say this is the first study to look at the effects of adding beet juice to a heathy person\u2019s diet without making any other diet or lifestyle changes.\n\nThe results appear in Nutrition Journal.\n\nIn the study, 15 men and 15 women drank either 17.6 ounces of a beet juice beverage consisting of about three-fourths beet juice and one-fourth apple juice, or a placebo juice. They were then monitored for 24 hours. The same procedure was repeated two weeks later, with those who drank the placebo on the first round receiving beetroot juice on the second.\n\nAmong both men and women, the results showed a trend to lower systolic blood pressure six hours after drinking the beet juice.\n\nBut when researchers limited their analysis to men only, they found a significant reduction of about 4.7 points among those who drank the beetroot juice.\n\nPrevious studies have also suggested that beetroot\u2019s blood-pressure-lowering effects may not be as strong in women.\n\nIn this case, Coles says it may be partially explained by the fact that the women in the study tended to be older, and many were on prescription medications, such as oral contraceptives.", "images":
