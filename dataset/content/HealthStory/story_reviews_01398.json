The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. But, cancer experts said, no one would do such a study today when mammograms are generally agreed to prevent breast cancer deaths. In the study, which is continuing, women were followed for a maximum of 8.9 years. It is possible that benefits may emerge later.\n\nNonetheless, the new study is \u201cvery credible,\u201d said Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health .\n\n\u201cThis is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,\u201d Dr. Kramer said. \u201cIt shows the relative impacts of screening versus therapy in an era in which therapy has been improving.\u201d\n\nDr. Otis Brawley of the American Cancer Society said in a statement that the investigators used \u201ccareful methodology.\u201d The society, Dr. Brawley said, \u201cbelieves that the total body of the science supports the fact that regular mammography is an important part of a woman\u2019s preventive health care .\u201d\n\nDr. Carol Lee, a radiologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and chairwoman of the breast imaging commission of the American College of Radiology, said the new study affirmed that mammography saves lives.\n\n\u201cMortality from breast cancer is decreasing, and I have to believe that screening mammography has played a part,\u201d Dr. Lee said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn their study, the investigators analyzed data from all 40,075 Norwegian women who had received a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1986 to 2005, a time when treatment was changing markedly.\n\nIn that period, 4,791 women died. And, starting in 1996, Norway began offering mammograms to women ages 50 to 69 and assigning multidisciplinary treatment teams to all women with breast cancer, similar to the teams at many major medical centers in the United States . The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate?\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

And Dr. Kramer said he knew of no evidence that breast cancer was more easily treated in women over 70 than in women ages 50 to 69.\n\nThat means, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth wrote in an additional analysis in an accompanying editorial, that mammography could have reduced the breast cancer death rate by as little as 2 percent, an amount so small that it is not really different from zero.\n\nTwo percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. But, he said, whatever the effect of mammograms is, \u201call the signals here are that it is much smaller than we believed.\u201d\n\nDr. Laura Esserman, a professor of surgery and radiology at the University of California in San Francisco , said it tells her that \u201cif you get the same treatment and the outcome is the same if you find it earlier or later, then you don\u2019t make a difference when you find it early.\u201d\n\nAnd screening has a cost, Dr. Welch said. Screening 2,500 50-year-olds for a decade would identify 1,000 women with at least one suspicious mammogram resulting in follow-up tests. Five hundred would have biopsies. And 5 to 15 of those women would be treated for cancers that, if left alone, would have grown so slowly they would never have been noticed.\n\nWhen the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago. After all, mammography had improved and, in Norway, each mammogram was independently read by two radiologists, which should make it less likely that cancers would be missed. The researchers expected mammograms to reduce the breast cancer death rate by a third.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe were surprised,\u201d said Dr. Mette Kalager, the lead author of the paper who is a breast surgeon at Oslo University and a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nMarvin Zelen, a statistician at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was a member of the research team said even though the mammography benefit is small, if he were a woman he would get screened.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on how you approach risk,\u201d Dr. Zelen said. His approach, he says, is \u201cminimax\u201d \u2014 he wants to minimize the maximum risk \u2014 which, in this case, is dying of a cancer.\n\nDr. Kalager came to the opposite conclusion. She worries about the small chance of benefit in light of the larger chance of finding and treating a cancer that did not need to be treated.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019m a breast cancer surgeon, I know what being treated is like,\u201d she says. The decision to be screened, she says, \u201cis a matter of personal preference. Is it worth it to risk becoming a patient without it being necessary?\u201d\n\nMany women may still want mammograms, she says, and that is fine.\n\n\u201cI think we have to respect what women want to do.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/23/us/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/23/us/mammogram/mammogram-jumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/23/us/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/health/research/23mammogram.html", "title": "Mammograms\u2019 Value in Cancer Fight at Issue", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069073644", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/health/research/23mammogram.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/health/research/23mammogram.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069073644"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/health/research/23mammogram.html", "title": "Mammograms\u2019 Value in Cancer Fight at Issue", "description": "A new study suggests awareness and treatments are the main force in reducing the breast cancer death rate.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "ginakolata"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "New Treatments Are Challenging Mammogram\u2019s Need, Study Says", "description": "A new study suggests awareness and treatments are the main force in reducing the breast cancer death rate.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1248069073644, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Mammograms\u2019 Value in Cancer Fight at Issue", "pdate": 20100922, "utime": 20171023144400, "ptime": 20100922182703, "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 22, 2010", "dat": "Sept. 22, 2010", "lp": "A new study suggests awareness and treatments are the main force in reducing the breast cancer death rate.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "23mammogram", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-09-22T18:27:03-04:00", "modified": "2017-10-23T14:44:00-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/section/health", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/gina.kolata.1", "tag": "Norway"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/health/research/23mammogram.html", "type": "article", "title": "Mammograms\u2019 Value in Cancer Fight at Issue", "description": "A new study suggests awareness and treatments are the main force in reducing the breast cancer death rate.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/23/us/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Gina Kolata", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By GINA KOLATA", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "research", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Breasts", "geo": "Norway", "keywords": "Mammography,Cancer,Breasts,Norway", "news_keywords": "Mammography,Cancer,Breast,Norway", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/23/us/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/research", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1285214400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
