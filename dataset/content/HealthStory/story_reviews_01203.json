The researchers then found a comparison group of women without the disease, who matched the first group in age, ethnicity and clinics where they received treatment.\n\nEarlier studies have found that women taking bisphosphonates have a lower risk of breast cancer. But it was unclear if that effect could be chalked up to the drugs, because the condition they are meant to treat \u2014 bone thinning, or osteoporosis \u2014 is tied to low estrogen levels, which also cuts breast cancer risk.\n\nColon cancer, on the other hand, has not been linked to estrogen, said Dr. Gad Rennert of the Carmel Medical Center in Haifa, whose findings are published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nHis team found that women who had been taking bisphosphonates \u2014 mainly the drug alendronate (Fosamax), which costs around $10 per month in the U.S. \u2014 for at least a year had a considerably lower risk of developing colon cancer later on.\n\nEven after considering other factors tied to the disease \u2014 like aspirin or statin use and eating lots of vegetables \u2014 their risk was 59 percent lower than that of women who hadn\u2019t taken the drugs.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, one in 19 men develops colorectal cancer at some point, and slightly fewer women do. The disease is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.\n\nRennert said in an e-mail that alendronate is used by millions of women across the globe and has few side effects. The long-term effects are less well-known, however, and in rare cases it can cause bone death of the jaw, which would be important if healthy people were to take it.\n\nAlso, not all patients asked to participate in the study agreed, which could limit the results further.\n\nJacobs of the American Cancer Society added that one earlier study from the UK had found no link between bisphosphonate and colon cancer. Indeed, it found a higher risk of throat cancer in patients on the medication.\n\n\u201cBased on current evidence, bisphosphonates should not be used for prevention of colorectal cancer,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cFortunately, there are proven ways to help prevent colorectal cancer. In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/aaGhWR Journal of Clinical Oncology, online February 14, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colon-cancer-idUSTRE71D6LS20110214", "title": "Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women taking certain bone drugs after menopause appear less likely to develop colon cancer, Israeli and U.S. researchers said Monday.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "United Kingdom,United States,US,COLON,CANCER", "news_keywords": "United Kingdom;United States;US;COLON;CANCER", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Feb 14 21:20:30 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-02-14T21:20:30+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colon-cancer-idUSTRE71D6LS20110214", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United Kingdom,United States,US,COLON,CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-COLON-CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer: study", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2011-02-14T21:20:30+0000", "sailthru.title": "Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colon-cancer-idUSTRE71D6LS20110214", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women taking certain bone drugs after menopause appear less l...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-02-14T21:20:30+0000", "modified_time": "2011-02-14T21:20:30+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "United Kingdom,United States,US,COLON,CANCER"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Women on bone drugs have less colon cancer: study", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women taking certain bone drugs after menopause appear less likely to develop colon cancer, Israeli and U.S. researchers said Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1297659600.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
