(Courtesy of Jessie Quinn)\n\nJessie Quinn of Sacramento was 36 years old when loss of appetite, weight loss, some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in 2010. Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly \u2014 and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.\n\nQuinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.\n\nIn fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d Quinn said.\n\nWhile searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby\u2019s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.\n\nColleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle helped create the cord-blood technique. (Courtesy of Colleen Delaney )\n\nThis therapy and another \u2014 haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient \u2014 have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cMany patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,\u201d said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.\n\nA dangerous process\n\nBone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person\u2019s immune system.\n\nThe transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient\u2019s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.\n\nThe process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.\n\nIn the past, a patient\u2019s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven\u2019t been exposed to much life \u2014 such as bacteria and viruses \u2014 and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren\u2019t a perfect match.\n\nWhen Quinn\u2019s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.\n\n1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The case files: Medical mysteries View Photos From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here\u2019s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Caption From a daily afternoon fever to a debilitating reaction to chemotherapy, here\u2019s a look at perplexing medical mystery cases. Doctors were stumped by this 2-year-old boy\u2019s symptoms. He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nBecause each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.\n\nThis expanded cord-blood technique has been a \u201chuge home run\u201d for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.\n\n\u201cNo one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,\u201d she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.\n\n\u201cThis is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cWe can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.\u201d\n\nQuinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.\n\nShe remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.\n\n\u201cIt still gives me pause \u2014 I went to Costa Rica \u2014 that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,\u201d Quinn says. \u201cI was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It\u2019s an indescribable feeling.\u201d\n\nIn haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient\u2019s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.\n\n\u2018Everybody now has a donor\u2019\n\n\u201cParents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSiblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.\u201d\n\nYet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.\n\n\u201cDespite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.\u201d\n\nJones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 \u2014 primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia \u2014 but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.\n\nGregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.\n\nHis wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease \u2014 acute myeloid leukemia \u2014 as doctors discussed treatment with them.\n\n\u201cWe knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,\u201d Caryn Gordon said. \u201cHe decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, \u2018Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.\n\n\u201cWe thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,\u201d Caryn recalled.\n\nAccording to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient\u2019s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.\n\nBut Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation. He also will be five years cancer-free in September.\n\nNot everyone is as lucky. Quinn, Gordon and 11 other participants in Delaney\u2019s clinical trial \u201care all alive, in remission, at a median age of about 4.7 years,\u201d the researcher said, but two patients died when the disease relapsed.\n\nA larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nHe beat leukemia, so why was he feeling so bad?\n\nNew therapies offer hope for a really bad brain cancer\n\nScientists just doubled the number of known contagious cancers", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/02/Health-Environment-Science/Images/111472833030.jpg?t=20170517", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/08/31/Health-Environment-Science/Images/CORDBLOOD11472668331.jpg?uuid=PV5LDm-pEeaZP3PGk6iYIA", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/02/Health-Environment-Science/Images/111472833030.jpg?uuid=ty3vBHEoEeaZP3PGk6iYIA", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/04/12/Interactivity/Images/CropMedical416b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/02/Health-Environment-Science/Images/111472833030.jpg?t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susan Berger", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/theres-new-hope-for-blood-cancers-and-it-comes-from-umbilical-cords/2016/09/02/04620816-2d89-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html", "title": "There\u2019s new hope for blood cancers, and it comes from umbilical cords", "meta_data": {"eomportal-uuid": "04620816-2d89-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c", "object-hash": 1573438544, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": "stem cell, bone marrow, blood cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, haploidentical, Be the Match, transplants, donor, infections, immune system", "news_keywords": "stem cell, bone marrow, blood cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, haploidentical, Be the Match, transplants, donor, infections, immune system", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/theres-new-hope-for-blood-cancers-and-it-comes-from-umbilical-cords/2016/09/02/04620816-2d89-11e6-9b37-42985f6a265c_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/09/02/Health-Environment-Science/Images/111472833030.jpg?t=20170517", "title": "There\u2019s new hope for blood cancers, and it comes from umbilical cords", "description": "Many people who would have died for lack of a blood-type match can now be saved."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "description": "Many people who would have died for lack of a blood-type match can now be saved.", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1472788800.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
