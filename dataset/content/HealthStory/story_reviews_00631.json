Dr. Derek H. Jones, a dermatologist and a principal investigator in a trial of the drug\u2019s effectiveness, found that people with the most fat had the most swelling. It usually cleared up in 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\u201cThat makes sense, because you\u2019re destroying more fat cells,\u201d said Dr. Jones, a paid consultant who will teach injectors and who treated Ms. Gallagher. In his experience, the first treatment is the most painful.\n\nThe injections will be commercially available in late summer, after doctors are trained to give them. The price for Kybella is not yet set.\n\nNot every patient is a good candidate for this treatment, several experts said. If a patient has excess fat and loose skin, Dr. Rohrich said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have a crepey neck and need a neck lift\u201d after fat is reduced with the shot. Neck lifts can cost $5,000 or more.\n\nImage Ms. Gallagher before the injections to slim down her double chin.\n\nThe drug does not target only fat cells. It will also destroy skin cells if inadvertently injected into the skin, the F.D.A. has warned.\n\n\u201cIf you inject into the dermis, you can hurt the skin,\u201d Dr. Rohrich said. \u201cThis drug needs to go into fat tissue to work.\u201d Misdirected injections could even harden skin, he said.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/30/science/30CHIN2/30CHIN2-jumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/01/science/30CHIN1/30CHIN1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/01/science/30CHIN1/30CHIN1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/01/science/30CHIN1/30CHIN1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catherine Saint Louis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/health/injection-kybella-double-chin.html", "title": "Injection Offers Option to Slim Down Double Chin Without Surgery", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-04-30T12:37:42.000Z", "modified": "2015-04-30T12:37:39.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/catherine-saint-louis", "tag": "Plastic Surgery", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003657620, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/467d2fc4-61af-526f-81fa-93502768f10f", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/43cf5c6a87e647c0a4bd7f722ba8aa17", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration approved on Wednesday the new treatment, whose active ingredient, deoxycholic acid, dissolves fat.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/01/science/30CHIN1/30CHIN1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Catherine Saint Louis", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/01/science/30CHIN1/30CHIN1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "news_keywords": "FDA,,Face,,Pharmaceuticals,Plastic surgery", "pdate": 20150430, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/health/injection-kybella-double-chin.html", "type": "article", "title": "Injection Offers Option to Slim Down Double Chin Without Surgery", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/01/science/30CHIN1/30CHIN1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "With an injection called Kybella, in trials at the time, Ashley Gallagher of Torrance, Calif., was able to reduce her double chin."}, "description": "The Food and Drug Administration approved on Wednesday the new treatment, whose active ingredient, deoxycholic acid, dissolves fat."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/health/injection-kybella-double-chin.html", "title": "Injection Offers Option to Slim Down Double Chin Without Surgery", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration approved on Wednesday the new treatment, whose active ingredient, deoxycholic acid, dissolves fat.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/01/science/30CHIN1/30CHIN1-articleLarge.jpg", "alt": "With an injection called Kybella, in trials at the time, Ashley Gallagher of Torrance, Calif., was able to reduce her double chin."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003657620"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/health/injection-kybella-double-chin.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003657620", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/health/injection-kybella-double-chin.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/health/injection-kybella-double-chin.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1430452800.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
