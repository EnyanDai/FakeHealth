While the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy, it has proven successful in building up patients\u2019 tolerance to peanuts over time, lessening the potential for life-threatening complications.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it,\u201d said allergist Stephen Tilles, MD, ACAAI former president, study co-author and consulting advisor for Aimmune Therapeutics, according to EurekAlert. \u201cOur hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day, many would tolerate as much as two peanuts. We were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to 12 months of treatment, and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts.\u201d\n\nFDA WARNS AGAINST HONEY PACIFIERS AFTER TEXAS INFANTS HOSPITALIZED WITH 'RARE' ILLNESS\n\nThe results, which were presented Sunday at the College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on study participants ranging in age from 4 to 55 years old. All participants, who mostly fell between ages 4 and 17, had a peanut allergy, but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time.\n\nParticipants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC).\n\n\u201cReactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment,\u201d Tilles said, according to EurekAlert. \u201cOn average, the participants were able to tolerate a 100-fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning. In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.\u201d\n\nEXPERTS: CHILDREN AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN CHATTANOOGA\n\nWith FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study\u2019s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy.\n\n\u201cThis is not a quick fix, and it doesn\u2019t mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,\u201d Jay Lieberman, MD, vice chair of the ACAAI Food Allergy Committee and study co-author, said, according to EurekAlert. \u201cBut it is definitely a breakthrough. The hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of 2019. If that happens, people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/meningitis_split.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/lollipop-ban-da-437275.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/22/931/524/694940094001_5738419118001_5738400845001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/life_support_istock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/alexandria_hein_26324r.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/22/694940094001_5738419118001_5738400845001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/steamer-horror-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/22/694940094001_5738419118001_5738400845001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/potential-life-saving-peanut-allergy-drug-on-horizon-scientists-say", "title": "Potential life-saving peanut allergy drug on horizon, scientists say", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Scientists are inching closer toward a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "health", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Alexandria Hein", "dc.title": "Potential life-saving peanut allergy drug on horizon, scientists say", "dcterms.abstract": "Scientists are inching closer toward a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Scientists are inching closer toward a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cf4eefbd-9beb-568a-a236-5dafa1816925", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-11-19", "dcterms.created": "2018-11-19T09:23:54-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-11-19T09:30:44-05:00", "og": {"title": "Potential life-saving peanut allergy drug on horizon, scientists say", "description": "Scientists are inching closer toward a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/22/694940094001_5738419118001_5738400845001-vs.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/potential-life-saving-peanut-allergy-drug-on-horizon-scientists-say", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Potential life-saving peanut allergy drug on horizon, scientists say", "description": "Scientists are inching closer toward a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/22/1024/512/694940094001_5738419118001_5738400845001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/potential-life-saving-peanut-allergy-drug-on-horizon-scientists-say"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/RESPIRATORY HEALTH/Allergy,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH", "classification-isa": "allergy,health"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
