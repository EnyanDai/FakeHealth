In a small, early study, carefully selected patients with cancer that had not spread beyond the inner lining of the uterus were treated with IUDs that released the hormone progesterone. The treatment was found to be as effective as oral hormone therapy, which is the most widely used nonsurgical, fertility-sparing treatment for the cancer. \u201cOur results show promise for the treatment of younger endometrial cancer patients with early disease who desire pregnancy in the future,\u201d gynecologic oncologist Lucas Minig tells WebMD. \u201cBut patients must be screened very carefully to make sure their disease has not spread.\u201d\n\nTreatment for Endometrial Cancer Close to 300,000 new cases of endometrial cancer are diagnosed worldwide annually, and roughly 75,000 women die of the disease. Surgical removal of the uterus and ovaries is a standard, and highly effective, treatment for early-stage disease. While most patients are diagnosed later in life, up to 5% of cases occur in women who are still in their 20s and 30s. Oral treatment with the synthetic progesterone is an accepted alternative to hysterectomy in carefully screened younger women with early endometrial cancer. The treatment slows tumor growth but is not well tolerated by some women.", "images":
