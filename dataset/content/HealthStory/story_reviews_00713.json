While the FDA has approved four medications for weight loss in the past 2 1/2 years, the Maestro system is the first weight loss device to be approved since 2007.\n\nUsing electrical leads implanted just above the stomach and a regulator carried under the skin near the ribcage, the device suppresses signals carried by the vagus nerve.\n\nThe device adopts a variant of a \u201cneuromodulation\u201d technique long used in the treatment of epilepsy: by applying intermittent bursts of electrical current to the vagus nerve, it disrupts the signals that prompt the stomach to relax, expand and prepare for an influx of food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe think it will be a very important tool in the toolbag of surgeons and physicians treating obesity and its co-morbidities,\u201d said Gregory S. Lea, senior vice president and chief financial officer of EnteroMedics. \u201cWhen patients leave the diet, counseling and drug world and have nothing more, they turn to surgical procedures, and only 1% to 2% of patients who might be eligible for bariatric surgery are getting it.\u201d\n\nThe FDA approved the use of the device in adult patients with a body mass index, or BMI, between 35 and 45, who have at least one other obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes.\n\nDelivered by the Maestro device, vagal blocking therapy, or VBLOC, offers obese patients a weight loss therapy that does not permanently alter the digestive system in the way that gastric bypass surgery does, and which may be less expensive, said Lea. He added it poses no risk of the \u201cmalabsorption\u201d problems that often come with such surgery.\n\nIn a 12-month clinical trial considered by the FDA, 38.3% of subjects who received the active Maestro device lost at least a quarter of their excess weight, and 52.5% of subjects lost at least 20% of their excess weight. On average, weight loss in those subjects with an active device was about 8.5% greater than that seen in subjects who received a Maestro electrical pulse generator that was not activated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe human body\u2019s longest cranial nerve, the vagus--or \u201cwandering\"--nerve stretches from the lower abdomen up to the brain stem, passing through the heart, esophagus and lungs. A key node in the body\u2019s involuntary nervous system, it carries signals between body and brain that control heart rate, digestive processes and respiration.\n\nIn a 60- to 90-minute laparoscopic procedure, physicians trained to implant the new device will attach its electrical leads to the anterior and posterior trunks of the vagus nerve, right at the gastric junction. During a patient\u2019s waking hours, the device is designed to alternate between delivering five-minute bursts of high-frequency energy and five minutes of inactivity. During sleep, the device powers down.\n\nBy suppressing the exchange of messages that cue hunger and ready the stomach for food, the intermittent electrical currents make most feel less hungry, feel full sooner and to feel full for longer. Most eat less and lose weight.\n\nResearchers testing the device also observed that, like bariatric surgery, it might have beneficial effects that go beyond weight loss. Suppressing signals between gut and brain on the vagus nerve appeared to improve the metabolic function of obese patients who got the device.\n\n\u201cYou actually see the effect before patients actually have had that much weight loss,\u201d said Dr. Ken Fujioka, a Scripps Institute endocrinologist and weight management expert who conducted some of the studies that led to the EnteroMedics device. That suggests that the device may be especially beneficial for those who have developed obesity-related type 2 diabetes, he said.\n\nThe on-again, off-again nature of the Maestro device\u2019s stimulation serves another purpose: it prevents the vagus nerve\u2019s gut signals from going silent--a communication loss that would likely prompt the central nervous system to find a compensatory workaround.\n\nAs a result, said Lea, the Maestro device appears to be safe and effective for long-term use, and unlike surgical alterations to the digestive system, reversible. Women who have had the device implanted and became pregnant were able to have it inactivated during their pregnancy, and then reactivated afterward, he said.\n\nWhile the cost of the device has not yet been set, Lea said that getting the device implanted and activated will likely cost \u201csomewhere between $20,000 and $30,000\"--an amount that is more than gastric banding but less some of the most complex gastric bypass surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has begun negotiations with private insurers, and the device has been been recognized as \u201cexploratory\u201d by the board that sets policy for Medicare reimbursements, and Lea expressed hope that some might agree to cover the procedure as early as later this year.\n\nWatching the nation\u2019s weight as well as your own?
