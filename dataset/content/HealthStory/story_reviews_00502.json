Most significantly, research showed a significant effect in reducing the risk of death with ACE inhibitors but not with ARBS. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs.\n\nBut some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat inconsistency created a confusing split in the medical community. Most guidelines set forth by the major medical groups suggest starting a patient with an ACE inhibitor first, but the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) considers ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equal.\n\nBangalore noticed that one assumption made in comparing the placebo trials -- that the patients in the group were about the same -- was incorrect. During that time period there was a remarkable shift in cardiovascular health care in America -- with a greater emphasis on not smoking, more statin use for cholesterol, better management of diabetes, lower targets for blood pressure.\n\n\"The patients in the '80s and '90s were a higher-risk group than those in the 2000s,\" Bangalore explained. \"If your risk is higher it's easier to show a benefit. If your risk is lower it's harder to show a benefit.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new analysis, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Monday, involves a second look at 106 randomized trials with 254,301 patients that took place after 2000 and shows that during this time period patient outcomes on the two medications were remarkably similar. The one difference they found was that ARBs tend to be better tolerated by patients, meaning that they have fewer side effects or result in fewer adverse events. ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated by many patients because they can produce a bothersome dry cough, and some end up stopping medication as a result.\n\nBangalore said this is critically important because \"compliance is big issue with our patients.\"\n\n\"With hypertension they are on these medications for decades, and it's important to choose one that will be the most tolerable,\" he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.\n\nThe study was limited to patients who did not have heart failure, and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.\n\nRead more:\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h3J54EVdZjzf-qT9XhmSrlrRueA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QYOASXUMI65NGOZD6OHEQNVSY.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3U5ML-m9dP0R-vfYWzMVCg261yQ=/150x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GEWMVKQUS47VNFVLWQ4JCWDHTA.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KHaoGQ4Oyc92lVjrWLXcV-YX5GI=/90x90/smart/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/8c3365b4-0b14-4270-ab2a-627279e3b650.png"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h3J54EVdZjzf-qT9XhmSrlrRueA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QYOASXUMI65NGOZD6OHEQNVSY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Eunjung Cha", "National Reporter", "Staff Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/04/new-class-of-blood-pressure-meds-as-effective-as-old-analysis-shows/", "title": "New class of blood pressure meds as effective as old, analysis shows", "meta_data": {"description": "A new study looked at more than 100 clinical trials and found that ARBS are just as effective as ACE inhibitors.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/01/04/new-class-of-blood-pressure-meds-as-effective-as-old-analysis-shows/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h3J54EVdZjzf-qT9XhmSrlrRueA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3QYOASXUMI65NGOZD6OHEQNVSY.jpg", "title": "New class of blood pressure meds as effective as old, analysis shows", "description": "A new study looked at more than 100 clinical trials and found that ARBS are just as effective as ACE inhibitors."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New class of blood pressure meds as effective as old, analysis shows", "description": "A new study looked at more than 100 clinical trials and found that ARBS are just as effective as ACE inhibitors."}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1451883600.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
