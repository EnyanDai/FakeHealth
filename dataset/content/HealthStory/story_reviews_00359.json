But after treatment, the group exposed to the bright light was scoring sexual satisfaction scores of around 6.3. In contrast, the control group only showed an average score of around 2.7 after treatment.\u201d", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sex-light-idUSKCN11P0QM", "title": "Study shines a light on low winter-time male libido", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;medical-research;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "Exposure to bright light can raise testosterone levels and lead to greater sexual satisfaction in men with low sexual desire, according to the results of a small scientific trial.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "Andrea Fagiolini,US,HEALTH,SEX,LIGHT,Western Europe,Sexual Health,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,United States,Automobiles / Auto Parts (Legacy),Health / Medicine,Living / Lifestyle,Psychology,Italy,Corporate Events,Austria,Europe,Men's Health,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Drug and Device Development,Healthcare (TRBC)", "news_keywords": "Andrea Fagiolini;US;HEALTH;SEX;LIGHT;Western Europe;Sexual Health;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);Human Interest / Brights / Odd News;United States;Automobiles / Auto Parts (Legacy);Health / Medicine;Living / Lifestyle;Psychology;Italy;Corporate Events;Austria;Europe;Men's Health;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Drug and Device Development;Healthcare (TRBC)", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Sep 19 09:20:46 UTC 2016", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2016-09-19T09:20:46+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sex-light-idUSKCN11P0QM", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Study shines a light on low winter-time male libido", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Andrea Fagiolini,US,HEALTH,SEX,LIGHT,Western Europe,Sexual Health,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,United States,Automobiles / Auto Parts (Legacy),Health / Medicine,Living / Lifestyle,Psychology,Italy,Corporate Events,Austria,Europe,Men's Health,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Drug and Device Development,Healthcare (TRBC)", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEALTH-SEX-LIGHT", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Study shines a light on low winter-time male libido", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2016-09-19T09:20:46+0000", "sailthru.title": "Study shines a light on low winter-time male libido", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Study shines a light on low winter-time male libido", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sex-light-idUSKCN11P0QM", "type": "article", "description": "Exposure to bright light can raise testosterone levels and lead to greater sexua...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-09-19T09:20:46+0000", "modified_time": "2016-09-19T09:20:46+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "Andrea Fagiolini,US,HEALTH,SEX,LIGHT,Western Europe,Sexual Health,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,United States,Automobiles / Auto Parts (Legacy),Health / Medicine,Living / Lifestyle,Psychology,Italy,Corporate Events,Austria,Europe,Men's Health,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Drug and Device Development,Healthcare (TRBC)"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Study shines a light on low winter-time male libido", "description": "Exposure to bright light can raise testosterone levels and lead to greater sexual satisfaction in men with low sexual desire, according to the results of a small scientific trial.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
