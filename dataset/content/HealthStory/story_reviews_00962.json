They lasted an average of 110 seconds before ejaculation, or nearly two minutes, over the three months they were followed, compared with 36 seconds before treatment.\n\n\"That's about what you see with standard drug therapy,\" says researcher J. David Prologo, MD, assistant professor of interventional radiology at Case Western Reserve University\u2019s School of Medicine in Cleveland. A time to ejaculation of more than two minutes is normal, he tells WebMD.\n\nIts supporters say the technique, or a similar one involving heat therapy, could someday become a standard treatment for the condition.\n\nBut other experts tell WebMD that questions about the long-term consequences remain. Also unknown: whether men would opt for the treatment.\n\nThe findings were presented here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. Prologo consults for Galil Medical, which funded the study.", "images":
