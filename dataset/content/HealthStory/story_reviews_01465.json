Colic affects up to 28% of infants and has no known cause or cure.\n\nHowever, recent research suggests colic may linked to an immature immune system struggling with bacterial imbalances in the gastrointestinal tract, and that high levels of E. coli bacteria in particular may contribute to colic symptoms. Some researchers question whether symptoms could be alleviated using probiotic therapy, or \"healthy\" bacteria to restore bacterial balance in the gut.\n\nTo test this theory, the Italian researchers compared 25 healthy infants who were randomly assigned to receive drops of Lactobacillus reuteri to 21 healthy infants randomly assigned to receive placebo drops. All the infants were diagnosed with colic, born full-term at a healthy gestational weight, had no history of gastrointestinal disorders, were breastfed, not formula fed, and did not receive any other probiotic supplements during the week prior to the study. The infants' mothers were also advised to avoid cow's milk in their own diets during the study period.", "images":
