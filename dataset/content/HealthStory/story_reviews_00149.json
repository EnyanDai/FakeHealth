She presented results of the study at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics medical conference in Denver; results were simultaneously published online Thursday by The Lancet.\n\nDr. Al-Lamee cautioned that the findings apply to a minority of the population of patients who now receive stents, those with narrowing of only one artery and certain other characteristics. She said the study doesn\u2019t apply to patients having heart attacks, who may benefit from stents, and to patients with chest pain who have disease in more than one artery.\n\nThe study also found that stents improved blood supply to the heart versus placebo, she said.\n\nStill, the study could affect a portion of a multibillion business for stent manufacturers including Medtronic PLC, Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific Corp. About 500,000 stents are implanted for stable angina each year world-wide, the study\u2019s researchers wrote in The Lancet.\n\nAbbott spokesman Jonathon Hamilton said the new study had patients with mild disease \u201cwho weren\u2019t reflective of patients who typically undergo stenting procedures,\u201d and that some patients received stents in the trial who wouldn\u2019t have gotten them otherwise because of the study design.\n\nMedtronic and Boston Scientific all referred questions about the study to a statement issued Thursday by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, whose members include cardiologists who perform stent procedures. The SCAI said it questioned the study\u2019s conclusions, and that SCAI believes stents are the preferred treatment for cardiac patients who need more than medicines to improve health and quality of life.\n\nBut some doctors said the study\u2019s outcome should discourage use of stents in many patients.\n\nThe results show \u201cunequivocally\u201d that there are no benefits for stent procedures compared with drugs for stable angina, two cardiologists wrote in an editorial accompanying the results in The Lancet.\n\nThe cardiologists, David L. Brown of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Rita F. Redberg of University of California, San Francisco, called for cardiology-treatment guidelines to downgrade the recommendation of stents for stable chest pain, and focus on treating these patients with medicine.\n\nPast studies have proven that stents can save lives when used in acute situations like heart attacks. But other studies have challenged their uses in patients with less severe disease and symptoms, including a landmark study released in 2007. Changes to treatment guidelines since then have curbed the over-use of stent procedures, according to a 2015 study .\n\nWhile the new study\u2019s findings are being debated, it is notable for its design: It is the first to compare stents with placebo while keeping patients in the dark about whether or not they received a stent. All patients had catheters inserted in an artery and were heavily sedated before being taken into a catheter lab. But only about half were given actual stents, while the rest were left on cath-lab tables for about 15 minutes, then had the catheters removed.\n\nResearchers chose this design to minimize the \u201cplacebo effect\u201d seen in past studies, in which a portion of symptom improvement in patients receiving stents could be attributed to their expectation that the stent would make them feel better.\n\nAll patients in the study took drugs including aspirin, anti-platelet drugs, cholesterol-lowering statins and beta blockers for about six weeks. This was followed by baseline treadmill tests and either the stent or sham procedure. They underwent treadmill tests again six weeks after the procedures. Researchers used exercise time as the main measure because physical exertion is usually what triggers angina, and it usually goes away when patients rest, Dr. Al-Lamee said.\n\nPatients receiving stents improved their exercise times by an average of 28 seconds, while those who didn\u2019t improved their times by an average of nearly 12 seconds. But the difference wasn\u2019t statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance.\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com", "images":
