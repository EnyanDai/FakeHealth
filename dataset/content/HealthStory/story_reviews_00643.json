Hladik was 74 when the day long anticipated by his doctors arrived: His kidneys, damaged years earlier by a viral infection, had lost 85 percent of their function.\n\nTime to begin dialysis.\n\nBut from the beginning, Mr. Hladik resisted. An IBM retiree, he loved fishing, boating and gardening \u2014 and hated hospitals. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to spend my time doing this,\u2019 \u201d recalled his son, Dr. Gerald A. Hladik. \u201cHe wanted to be at home with his dog. He wanted to be able to go to the beach.\u201d\n\nA nephrologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Dr. Hladik understood better than most how kidney dialysis could consume a patient\u2019s days. His father\u2019s eventful medical history included a serious stroke and coronary bypass surgery.\n\n\u201cDialysis may have prolonged his life, but I suspect only by a couple of months,\u201d Dr. Hladik said.\n\nSo after considerable discussion, Mr. Hladik decided to skip the three weekly trips to a renal center, along with the resulting fatigue and dietary and travel restrictions. His doctors managed his heart disease and hypertension with drugs. He died at home in November, a year and a half after saying no to dialysis.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/31/science/31SPAN-Color/31SPAN-Color-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/31/science/31SPAN-Color/31SPAN-Color-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/31/science/31SPAN-Color/31SPAN-Color-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paula Span"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/health/learning-to-say-no-to-dialysis.html", "title": "Learning to Say No to Dialysis", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-03-27T19:49:19.000Z", "modified": "2015-03-27T19:49:17.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/paula-span", "tag": "United States Renal Data System", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003593349, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/ca232814-0409-582d-8334-ea742f8a2f79", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/dbc1325edb8345ec9f41c65f9aa84315", "description": "Some older adults with advanced kidney failure are resisting the usual answer by deciding the sacrifices required by the treatment aren\u2019t worth it.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/31/science/31SPAN-Color/31SPAN-Color-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Paula Span", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/31/science/31SPAN-Color/31SPAN-Color-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Kidney,,Old age;elderly;senior citizens,Dialysis,United States Renal Data System", "pdate": 20150327, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/health/learning-to-say-no-to-dialysis.html", "type": "article", "title": "Learning to Say No to Dialysis", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/31/science/31SPAN-Color/31SPAN-Color-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "Some older adults with advanced kidney failure are resisting the usual answer by deciding the sacrifices required by the treatment aren\u2019t worth it."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/health/learning-to-say-no-to-dialysis.html", "title": "Learning to Say No to Dialysis", "description": "Some older adults with advanced kidney failure are resisting the usual answer by deciding the sacrifices required by the treatment aren\u2019t worth it.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/31/science/31SPAN-Color/31SPAN-Color-articleLarge.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003593349"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "CN": "the-new-old-age", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/health/learning-to-say-no-to-dialysis.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003593349", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/health/learning-to-say-no-to-dialysis.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/health/learning-to-say-no-to-dialysis.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1427774400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
