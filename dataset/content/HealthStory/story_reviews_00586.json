Forty percent of those who had received a gastric bypass procedure and 29% who received a gastric band were considered in remission from diabetes and no longer needed to take medication after three years. In comparison, no one in the group who received intensive lifestyle intervention resolved their diabetes.\n\n\u201cI do think it adds strongly to the growing body of data that [surgery] should be considered\u201d to treat people with obesity and diabetes, said Anita Courcoulas, head of minimally invasive bariatric and general surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who led the study.\n\nHowever, to conclude firmly that surgery is the better option, data from more patients across several different treatment centers, followed for up to seven years after surgery, is needed, according to Dr. Courcoulas. Her group is conducting such a study, along with researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle, the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston and the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association lists surgery as one option in its 2015 medical care guidelines for diabetic patients with a body-mass index over 35 but says there is insufficient evidence of benefit in those who are less overweight.\n\n\u201cIn general, I agree that short-term outcomes for bariatric surgery...are more dramatic than that seen with lifestyle intervention,\u201d wrote Jane Chiang, senior vice president for medical affairs and community information at the American Diabetes Association, in an email. However, \u201cnot everyone is a strong candidate for bariatric surgery.\u201d Treatment should be tailored to each patient, she said.\n\nThe ADA\u2019s Professional Practice Committee, which develops its medical guidelines, will carefully review the study and assess if any changes to clinical practice are warranted, according to Dr. Chiang.\n\nIn 2011, the International Diabetes Federation announced a position change stating that surgical options should be considered earlier on for eligible patients to help prevent complications from Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe new study, which began in 2009, didn\u2019t look at a bariatric surgery procedure that has become popular in recent years, known as the sleeve gastrectomy, said Dr. Courcoulas. However, a study by the Cleveland Clinic published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine did, and found a similar significant improvement in Type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery procedures, including the sleeve gastrectomy, over lifestyle intervention.\n\nWhy bariatric surgery clears up diabetes isn\u2019t fully understood and patients have different degrees of response to the procedures, said Dr. Courcoulas. Patients who undergo surgery usually lose significantly more weight than those receiving lifestyle intervention, but their diabetes often clears up before they lose a significant amount of weight, suggesting that weight loss alone isn\u2019t the reason.\n\nSome doctors say gastric bypass surgery appears especially beneficial, possibly because the procedure involves reducing the stomach to the size of a small pouch and bypassing a portion of the intestine, which potentially changes certain gastrointestinal hormones or other factors.\n\nMichel Gagner, a clinical professor of surgery at Florida International University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study but wrote an editorial accompanying the piece in the journal, said bariatric surgery should be used much more widely to treat diabetes, the way that heart surgery was widely used to treat coronary artery disease.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many studies we need to do to keep comparing the best medical treatment to surgery, but it\u2019s clear to me that surgery is the only thing that offers resolution to diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Gagner.\n\nWrite to Shirley S.
