Before researchers try a compound on humans, it\u2019s tested at labs in petri dishes and on animals, such as mice and monkeys. More often than not, these studies produce mixed data that don\u2019t tell researchers much about whether it is safe and effective for humans.\n\nFor some time, scientists have been searching for ways to cut down on the cost and failure rate of drug testing. Researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University have developed a beautiful solution: Organs-On-Chips.\n\nThe clear and flexible polymer microchips are lined with human cells. Each one represents a different human organ system, such as lungs, heart and intestines. The institute\u2019s goal is to create 10 different organ systems that can be joined together by blood vessel channels to simulate human physiology on a microscale and provide a cheaper, more reliable way to test new drugs.\n\nTry Newsweek for only $1.25 per week\n\nThe sophisticated architecture of these organs-on-chips\u2014which are about the size of a thumb drive\u2014has also earned the Wyss Institute recognition in the art world with a Design of the Year award from the Design Museum and placement in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s permanent collection.\n\n\u201cThe real power of this approach is that you have a window to the inner workings of life,\u201d says Don Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute and a professor of Vascular Biology and of Bioengineering at Harvard University. \u201cAnything you can ask at the molecular level, we could do in our chips.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the team built and tested its first \u201corganoid\u201d chip to mimic the mechanical function of human lungs. It contains tiny channels separated by a porous membrane to create two distinct, hollow passageways\u2014one lined with human lung cells and the other with capillary blood vessel cells. Air is suctioned through the side channels to emulate breathing. Ingber and his team introduced bacteria into the chip\u2019s lung channel and white blood cells into the capillary channel. They observed that the white blood cells permeated the membrane and attacked the bacteria in the lung cell channel\u2014exactly what would happen in human lungs fighting off an infection.\n\nIn another experiment, the team at Wyss filled a chip\u2019s lung cell channel with interleukin 2, a chemotherapy drug known to cause pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs. When air entered the lung cell channel, the channel filled with fluid and then blood clots\u2014exactly what happens in the lungs of patients who develop this life-threatening condition. This proved the chips could provide real world information to scientists studying the effects of new drug compounds.\n\nThe project has received support from the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency also recently awarded the institute a $37 million grant to create chips representing nearly all systems in the body. Ingber says some scientists are interested in using the chips to conduct research that would be unethical if performed on people, such as studying the effects of gamma radiation on the human body.\n\nOf course, the chips have limitations. \u201cWe can\u2019t mimic consciousness; we can\u2019t mimic compression on a joint,\u201d says Ingber.\n\nDanilo Tagle, associate director for special initiatives at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, a division of the NIH, is spearheading a similar organ-on-chip project. He suspects that in the beginning the chips will be used to \u201ccomplement and supplement\u201d animal studies, but will eventually become routine practice. The chips will also provide researchers with information on dosing at a much earlier stage in drug studies\u2014particularly helpful because animals metabolize chemical substances at a different rate than humans. \u201cYou can go forward with a candidate drug with greater assurance and confidence that it will have the desired effect on humans,\u201d says Tagle. \u201cBiology is very complex.\u201d\n\nIncorporating the chips into drug testing could save millions of dollars and years of time on research. Some companies are already trying out the concept. Janssen Pharmaceuticals Company, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is using a version of the chips to understand how blood clots in the lungs. The information is essential to reduce the risk for this side effect of oncology drugs.\n\nThough there still aren\u2019t enough data to prove the chips are reliable enough to put rodents out of a job, Ingber says it\u2019s only a matter of time; they hope to have them tested and ready for market in two years. \u201cThe FDA has been very supportive,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve told us if they are as good as animals that they would consider accepting data provided by a drug company from one of these models rather than an animal model.\u201d", "images":
