Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. About 15 million Americans have food allergies, including 1 in 13 children, according to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) group. Eight foods account for 90 percent of all reactions: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish and shellfish.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11.\n\nThe skin patch \u2014 intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen \u2014 may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.\n\n\u201cMany have been told all their lives that if they ingest peanuts they will have a severe reaction and die,\" he said. \"So it\u2019s tough to get them to take it. With this you just slap a little patch on their backs.\u201d\n\nAlthough some volunteers experienced redness and itchiness at the site of the patch, there were no serious side effects. Just two dropped out because of flare-ups of eczema.\n\n\u201cThe goal for most practicing allergists and for most parents is to get a child to the point where if there is an accidental ingestion of peanut it would not be as risky or life-threatening,\u201d said Dr. Amy Stallings, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the division of allergy and immunology at the Duke University Medical Center who is not affiliated with the new study. \u201cAnd the patch may be a way of doing this that is safer.\u201d\n\nThe patch study's results are promising, although researchers need to continue following the participants for another year, Sampson said. It could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers.\n\nResearchers are trying to discover why food allergies have increased among children \u2014 the number of kids living with peanut or tree nut allergies tripled between 1997 and 2008, studies show \u2014 but there\u2019s no clear answer. Allergies to peanuts and tree nuts tend to begin in childhood and are usually lifelong.", "images": ["https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_08/430001/2d274907871405-today-peanut-allergy-150222-streams_desktop_medium_70bf6abb9d3b042971ef3f2a95e202ce.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_43/1380012/weekend_team2x_3b631839bdbf4518d5d31685d78b3cbf.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_08/430001/2d274907871405-today-peanut-allergy-150222-streams_desktop_medium_70bf6abb9d3b042971ef3f2a95e202ce.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/health/peanut-patch-may-protect-against-life-threatening-allergy-t4671", "title": "'Peanut patch' may protect against life-threatening allergy", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/health/peanut-patch-may-protect-against-life-threatening-allergy-t4671", "title": "Life-saving 'peanut patch' may protect against allergy", "description": "For those plagued with peanut allergies, protection may eventually come in the form of a patch worn on the skin, a new study suggests.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_08/430001/2d274907871405-today-peanut-allergy-150222-streams_desktop_medium_70bf6abb9d3b042971ef3f2a95e202ce.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_08/430001/2d274907871405-today-peanut-allergy-150222-streams_desktop_medium_70bf6abb9d3b042971ef3f2a95e202ce.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_08/430001/2d274907871405-today-peanut-allergy-150222-streams_desktop_medium_70bf6abb9d3b042971ef3f2a95e202ce.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Life-saving 'peanut patch' may protect against allergy", "description": "For those plagued with peanut allergies, protection may eventually come in the form of a patch worn on the skin, a new study suggests.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "For those plagued with peanut allergies, protection may eventually come in the form of a patch worn on the skin, a new study suggests.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_08/430001/2d274907871405-today-peanut-allergy-150222-streams_desktop_medium_70bf6abb9d3b042971ef3f2a95e202ce.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1424661612.0, "source": "http://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
