Recipients were at most seven years older or younger than the donors. The study is in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.\n\nIn an average follow-up of five years, they found that the rate of unusable donor kidneys and the long-term outcomes of recipients varied little among the first three age groups \u2014 around 18 percent of the organs had to be discarded, and the five-year survival was about 88 percent", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/well/well_pog_body/well_pog_body-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/well/well_pog_body/well_pog_body-articleLarge-v3.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/well/well_pog_body/well_pog_body-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Bakalar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/well/live/never-too-old-to-be-an-organ-donor.html", "title": "Never Too Old to Be an Organ Donor", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2016-12-15T22:00:03.000Z", "modified": "2016-12-15T22:00:01.000Z", "section": "Well", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-bakalar", "tag": "Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004822083, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/381a1f09-6899-5303-af43-56c73d9a24a9", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/24f1767cc4974a55b6c2e351af37417a", "description": "A kidney transplanted from a deceased 79-year-old can be as effective as one from a person 30 years younger, a new study found.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/well/well_pog_body/well_pog_body-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg", "byl": "By Nicholas Bakalar", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/well/well_pog_body/well_pog_body-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "news_keywords": ",Kidney,Transplants,Organ donation,Old age;elderly;senior citizens,Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology", "pdate": 20161215, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/well/live/never-too-old-to-be-an-organ-donor.html", "type": "article", "title": "Never Too Old to Be an Organ Donor", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/well/well_pog_body/well_pog_body-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg", "description": "A kidney transplanted from a deceased 79-year-old can be as effective as one from a person 30 years younger, a new study found."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/well/live/never-too-old-to-be-an-organ-donor.html", "title": "Never Too Old to Be an Organ Donor", "description": "A kidney transplanted from a deceased 79-year-old can be as effective as one from a person 30 years younger, a new study found.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/well/well_pog_body/well_pog_body-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v4.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004822083"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "well", "SCG": "live", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/well/live/never-too-old-to-be-an-organ-donor.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004822083", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/well/live/never-too-old-to-be-an-organ-donor.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/well/live/never-too-old-to-be-an-organ-donor.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1481778000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
