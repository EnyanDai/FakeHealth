Veins contain valves that, when stretched, no longer keep blood moving back toward the heart efficiently. Risk factors include genetics , age and standing still for prolonged periods.\n\nEighty-seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment, according to a 2008 survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted nationwide by Vein Clinics of America and Opinion Research Corporation. But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, swelling and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.\n\nThe treatment known as sclerotherapy \u2014 an alternative to surgery \u2014 entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.\n\nVein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. \u201cYou have some legal exposure by doing so,\u201d said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater Phoenix .\n\nPhoto\n\nThat said, polidocanol was the \u201csecond most commonly used sclerosing agent\u201d because, he said, \u201cmost physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.\u201d\n\nF.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were \u201cwrong\u201d and had \u201clots of contaminants\u201d that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A. Weiss, a Baltimore dermatologist who directs the Maryland Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera \u201cis very safe for skin.\u201d\n\nAn injector\u2019s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, ulcers (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Using ultrasound to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. \u201cThe underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,\u201d said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center . \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll just come back.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nToday, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. Yet, he said both are \u201cvery safe and effective, and a heck of a lot better than surgery.\u201d (It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.)\n\nFor Dianne Brought, who manages a clothing shop in Ocean City , Md., each time Dr. Weiss injected her with STS, she felt only \u201ca little tiny pinch.\u201d But she cautioned that if \u201canybody hates needles they will mind it.\u201d Ms. Brought, 57, said her legs used to have \u201cvery nasty veins\u201d and her calves hurt. She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.\n\nSome vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A \u201csudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,\u201d said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.\n\nDr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was \u201cvery safe,\u201d but that \u201cit is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.\u201d Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke \u201cmay have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.\u201d\n\nBut foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients. Judson Emerick, an art history professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., had varicose veins so troublesome that he kept getting skin ulcers that failed to heal. Plus, his \u201clegs looked like a sack of walnuts,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a series of injections with Dr. Bunke, his ulcers have subsided and he is thrilled. \u201cMy wife looked at me, and my veins had disappeared,\u201d said Mr. Emerick, 68. \u201cMy calves and definition were visible again.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/11/fashion/skininline/skininline-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin_CA0/13Skin_CA0-articleLarge.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin_CA0/13Skin_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/fashion/13skinside_CA0/13skinside_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin_CA0/13Skin_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catherine Saint Louis", "Skin Deep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin.html", "title": "U.S. Approves Drug to Treat Varicose Veins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1247467824251", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1247467824251"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin.html", "title": "U.S. Approves Drug to Treat Varicose Veins", "description": "Asclera, a vein injection drug, has been approved by the F.D.A. for treating varicose veins.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "cslwrites"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "New Help to Free Legs From a Web", "description": "Asclera, a vein injection drug, has been approved by the F.D.A. for treating varicose veins.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1247467824251, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "U.S. Approves Drug to Treat Varicose Veins", "col": "Skin Deep", "pdate": 20100511, "utime": 20171026205200, "ptime": 20100511182554, "DISPLAYDATE": "May 11, 2010", "dat": "May 11, 2010", "lp": "Asclera, a vein injection drug, has been approved by the F.D.A. for treating varicose veins.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "13Skin", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-05-11T18:25:54-04:00", "modified": "2017-10-26T20:52:00-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "section-taxonomy-id": "B3DFBD82-F298-43B3-9458-219B4F6AA2A5", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/section/fashion", "top-level-section": "fashion", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/catherine-saint-louis", "tag": "Varicose Veins"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin.html", "type": "article", "title": "U.S. Approves Drug to Treat Varicose Veins", "description": "Asclera, a vein injection drug, has been approved by the F.D.A. for treating varicose veins.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin_CA0/13Skin_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Catherine Saint Louis", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS", "PT": "article", "CG": "fashion", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Varicose Veins", "keywords": "Legs,Varicose Veins", "news_keywords": "Leg,Varicose veins", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/fashion/13Skin_CA0/13Skin_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "nyt-collection": {"display-name": "Skin Deep", "identifier": "skin-deep", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/column/skin-deep", "uri": "/column/skin-deep", "tone": "feature", "tagline": "Tips and trends for hair, makeup and more.", "type": "column"}, "CN": "skin-deep", "CT": "column", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "fashion", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1273723200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
