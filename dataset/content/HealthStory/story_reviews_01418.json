Unfortunately, our previous study indicated that, despite their benefits, many patients on statins discontinue their treatment,\" Chodick said.\n\nThis work received no outside or corporate finding, the researchers noted.\n\nDr. Robert Myerburg, a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, stressed that \"this is a study looking for an association, and it doesn't prove that starting statins early in life will prevent or delay the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.\"\n\nThe only way to prove the connection is with a clinical trial, Myerburg said. \"At this point, I would not use a statin for that [prevention of rheumatoid arthritis] indication,\" he said.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more information on statins, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "images": ["http://consumer.Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "http://consumer.Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steven Reinberg"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/bone-and-joint-information-4/arthritis-drug-news-39/statins-may-guard-against-rheumatoid-arthritis-642906.html", "title": "Statins May Guard Against Rheumatoid Arthritis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "Study showed only an association between the two, expert notes", "og": {"title": "Statins May Guard Against Rheumatoid Arthritis", "description": "Study showed only an association between the two, expert notes", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/bone-and-joint-information-4/arthritis-drug-news-39/statins-may-guard-against-rheumatoid-arthritis-642906.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://consumer.Healthday.com", "summary": ""}
