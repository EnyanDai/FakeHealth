REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nA small-scale pilot study of psilocybin\u2019s use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said.\n\nOf 12 patients given the drug, all showed some decrease in symptoms of depression for at least three weeks. Seven continued to show a positive response at three months. Five remained in remission beyond the three months.\n\nRobin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London\u2019s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking.\n\nMany patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world.\n\n\u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t get carried away with these results,\u201d he told reporters at a briefing in London. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a magic bullet. We\u2019re just learning how to do this treatment.\u201d\n\nMagic mushrooms grow worldwide and have been used since ancient times, both for recreation and for religious rites.\n\nBritish researchers led by David Nutt, a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, have been exploring the potential of psilocybin to ease severe forms of depression in people who don\u2019t respond to other treatments.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that some 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression, a common mental disorder characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, tiredness, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep and appetite, and poor concentration.\n\nMany patients respond to treatment with anti depressants and cognitive behavioral therapy, but around 20 percent don\u2019t get better and are classed as having treatment-resistant depression.\n\nPsilocybin acts on the serotonin system, suggesting it could be developed for treating depression. But hallucinogenic drugs can also cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so Nutt\u2019s team wanted to find out if psilocybin can be given safely.\n\nThe trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They all went through a full screening process before being allowed to participate and they were fully supported before, during and after they received psilocybin.\n\nThe patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.\n\nBlood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored during each session, and the patients were seen by a psychiatrist the next day and one, two, three and five weeks after the second dose.\n\n\"Pappardelle Magic Mushroom Truffles\" prepared by chef Harlan Goldstein is shown at Gold restaurant in Hong Kong March 6, 2012. REUTERS/Andy Ho\n\nCarhart-Harris said no serious side effects were reported during the study, although all volunteers said they were slightly anxious before and during initial drug administration.\n\n\u201cPsychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms. That kind of approach could be risky.\u201d\n\nNutt said the results showed that psilocybin \u201cis safe and fast acting, so may - if administered carefully - have value for these patients.\u201d",
