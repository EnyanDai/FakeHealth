Meanwhile, it was common among women at low fracture risk, such as younger women without osteoporosis risk factors,\" Amarnath said in a journal news release.\n\nWhat to do? Reminder notes to doctors and patients might help, one expert said.\n\n\"Health systems should invest in developing electronic health records systems that prompt providers at the point-of-care when screening is needed and when it can be postponed,\" study senior author Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at UC Davis, said in the news release.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians has more about osteoporosis.", "images": ["http://consumer.healthday.com/images/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "http://consumer.healthday.com/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Preidt"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/bone-and-joint-information-4/bone-joint-and-tendon-news-72/too-many-women-who-need-bone-screening-aren-t-getting-it-699578.html", "title": "Too Many Women Who Need Bone Screening Aren't Getting It", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "California study found that patients at highest risk for fractures often miss out on tests", "og": {"title": "Too Many Women Who Need Bone Screening Aren't Getting It", "description": "California study found that patients at highest risk for fractures often miss out on tests", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/bone-and-joint-information-4/bone-joint-and-tendon-news-72/too-many-women-who-need-bone-screening-aren-t-getting-it-699578.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://consumer.healthday.com", "summary": ""}
