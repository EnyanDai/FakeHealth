We haven\u2019t had any entertaining with beers. So that\u2019s why I developed this pill \u2013 for my friend,\u201d Hoon Sunwoo, an associated professor of pharmaceutical sciences at UAlberta, told the CBC.\n\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder in the small intestine that makes patients sensitive to gluten. Patients would take Sunwoo\u2019s pill five minutes before eating and have a one-to-two hour window of eating foods they typically avoid, the CBC reported.\n\nHowever, Sunwoo warns the pill is neither a long-term solution for patients nor is it a cure for the disease\u2014 just an aid to help improve quality of life.\n\n\u201cThis is not treating the celiac disease or curing celiac disease,\u201d he told local media. \u201cIt\u2019s just to try to help them improve their quality of life so when they want to socialize with peers or friends.\u201d\n\nResearchers expect to begin clinical trials with the pill in 2016, CBC reported.", "images":
