Behavioral counseling is widely recommended, with medication, to help smokers quit.\n\nThe results of the new study are published online in Tobacco Control. The findings are at odds with clinical trials, Connolly says. The new study, however, draws from the population. It gives a more ''real world'' picture, he tells WebMD.\n\nSmoking cessation experts and a maker of nicotine replacement therapies took issue with the findings.\n\nConnolly does not advocate abandoning the nicotine replacement medication. Instead, he suggests understanding its use. \"In the short term, what it is designed for is treatment of withdrawal,\" he says. \"Long term, our study would not say it would prevent relapse.\" Better strategies are needed to prevent relapse, he tells WebMD.", "images":
