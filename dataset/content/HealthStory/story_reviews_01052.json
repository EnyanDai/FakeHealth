Most of the population is thought to get adequate amounts for that reason.\n\nDuring the study, Sweden did not fortify foods, nor did kids use a lot of supplements. Folic acid is naturally present in green, leafy vegetables and legumes.\n\nThe new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues.\n\nThe researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets.\n\nTeens in the top third of folic acid intake \u2014 more than 253 micrograms per day for girls and 335 for boys \u2014 scored grades of 139 out of 200, on average. Those in the bottom third \u2014 less than 173 micrograms folic acid per day for girls and 227 for boys \u2014 had an average score of only 120.\n\nThe differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers\u2019 education and which schools the kids went to.\n\nO\u2019Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings \u201cpretty significant.\u201d\n\nStill, she said, you can\u2019t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a randomized controlled trial, so you always wonder, are there other things going on that you weren\u2019t able to control for?\u201d she said. \u201cLike most studies, it probably raises more questions than it answers.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., kids aged 9 to 13 should get a total of 300 micrograms of folate a day from food and supplements according to the Institute of Medicine\u2019s \u201cDietary Reference Intakes.\u201d Kids 14 and older and adults are urged to get 400 micrograms a day and pregnant women should get 600 micrograms.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/cxXOG Pediatrics, online July 11, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-folic-acid-idUSTRE76A0S320110711", "title": "Folic acid tied to better grades in Swedish teens", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
