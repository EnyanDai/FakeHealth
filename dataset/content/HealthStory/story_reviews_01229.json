REUTERS/File\n\nResearchers from the University of East Anglia said their findings could lead within a decade to the development of new medicines to halt a critical late stage of the disease known as metastasis, when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body.\n\nThe culprit gene, called WWP2, is an enzymic bonding agent found inside cancer cells, the researchers explained in their study, published in the journal Oncogene Monday.\n\nIt attacks and breaks down a naturally-occurring protein in the body which normally prevents cancer cells from spreading.\n\nIn tests in the laboratory, the UEA team found that by blocking WWP2, levels of the natural inhibitor protein were boosted and the cancer cells remained dormant.\n\nSurinder Soond, who worked on the study, said it was a \u201cnovel and exciting approach to treating cancer and the spread of tumors which holds great potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe challenge now is to identify a potent drug that will get inside cancer cells and destroy the activity of the rogue gene,\u201d said Andrew Chantry of UEA\u2019s school of biological sciences, who led the research.\n\nHe said this was \u201ca difficult but not impossible task\u201d and one that would be made easier by the better understanding of the biological processes gained in this early research.\n\nChantry said in a telephone interview the findings mean drugs could be developed in the next 10 years that could be used to halt the aggressive spread of many forms of cancer, including breast cancer, brain, colon and skin cancer.\n\nIf a drug was developed that deactivated WWP2, he said, conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy could be used on primary tumors with no risk of the disease taking hold elsewhere.\n\nHe said his team is now working with other scientists to try to design a drug which could interrupt the gene\u2019s activity.", "images":
