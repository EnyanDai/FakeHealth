REUTERS/Gary Cameron\n\nEarlier studies had suggested that aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help protect against colorectal cancer, but it wasn\u2019t clear how much had to be taken, and for how long, to achieve those benefits.\n\nNow, using data on more than 113,000 individuals, researchers have been trying to sort out the relationship between aspirin and NSAIDs, duration of treatment, and colorectal cancer rates.\n\nIn general, the risk of developing colorectal cancer varies with age, race, ethnicity and lifestyle. More than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed in people older than 50, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nAn online risk calculator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available here: 1.usa.gov/1DlscTL) indicates that in the U.S., for an average white or black woman in her late fifties, the 10-year risk of developing colorectal cancer is between 1 and 1.4 percent, and her lifetime risk is between 5 and 5.4 percent. For an average black or white male of the same age, the corresponding risks would be about 1.4 percent and 5.8 percent.\n\nIn the new study from Denmark, taking low-dose aspirin continuously for at least five years appeared to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 27%, and using nonaspirin NSAIDs for at least five years appeared to reduce it by 30%.\n\nOn the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\u201cUnless low-dose aspirin is taken continuously, there is little protection against colorectal cancer,\u201d Dr. Soren Friis from the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen told Reuters Health.\n\nNonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, \u201cand there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,\u201d Dr. Friis said.\n\nAspirin and NSAIDs carry their own risks, however. Long-term use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, so the potential reduction in colon cancer risk needs to be balanced against potential side effects, the authors warn.\n\nThe study had several limitations. For instance, the researchers only had data for users who obtained their aspirin or NSAIDs from doctors\u2019 prescriptions. They didn\u2019t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Also, the researchers can\u2019t rule out the possibility that other factors may have increased participants\u2019 risk for colorectal cancer, such as obesity, dietary habits, alcohol use, and family history of colorectal cancer.\n\nDr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings.\n\n\u201cSelf-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,\u201d Dr. Friis said. \u201cThe public should not take any medication regularly without consulting with a physician.\u201d\n\nDr. Gurpreet Singh Ranger from Upper River Valley Hospital, Waterville, New Brunswick and Dalhousie Medical School, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, agreed with Dr. Friis.\n\n\u201cLow dose aspirin, already taken regularly by millions, reduces the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email. But \u201cbefore starting to take aspirin long term, it is important to discuss the implications with your family doctor or specialist.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1i46lF7 Annals of Internal Medicine, online August 24, 2015.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150824&t=2&i=1074267928&r=LYNXNPEB7N13O&w=20", "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150824&t=2&i=1074267928&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEB7N13O"], "top_img": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150824&t=2&i=1074267928&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEB7N13O", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Will Boggs Md", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-colorectalcancer-prevention-idUSKCN0QT2CV20150824", "title": "An aspirin a day \u2013 for years \u2013 may keep colon cancer away", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;medical-research;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
