It has almost 100,000 entries.\n\nThe app is designed to record how using marijuana corresponds to changes in the intensity of symptoms and any side effects a person experiences. It helps \"track and learn which types of cannabis, dosing and ingestion methods work best.\"\n\nThe study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology found that users suffering from 27 different health conditions with symptoms ranging from seizures to depression reported a mean reduction in symptoms of 2.8 to 4.6 points on a zero to 10 point scale after consuming cannabis in various forms, including concentrates and topicals. People using the drug to treat anxiety- and depression-related symptoms reported more relief than people with pain symptoms.\n\nIn the second study, researchers examined how cannabis buds treated insomnia. Cannabis users on the Releaf App experienced a reduction of symptom severity of an average 4.5 points on a zero to 10 point scale. According to the study, people who consumed the drug via pipes and vaporizers experienced greater relief of symptoms, and those who vaped experienced fewer negative effects.\n\nAccording to the release, data from the app showed that an overall 94 percent of cannabis users suffering from a variety of health conditions reported that the intensity of their symptoms was reduced after consuming the drug. Additionally, use of marijuana was associated with non-serious side effects.\n\n\"If the results found in our studies can be extrapolated to the general population, cannabis could systematically replace multi-billion dollar medication industries around the world. It is likely already beginning to do so,\" Jacob Vigil, co-author of the studies, said in the release.", "images": ["https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b34d31c/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F6a%2F3f3fa241479aa1accecb1bf7841b%2F180911-marijuana-editorial.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/6e1ec35/2147483647/thumbnail/303x202/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2Fe3%2F18dd022b4c4f83f83c314d4722fc%2F161116-medicalmarijuana-stock.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/0861ff0/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F6a%2F3f3fa241479aa1accecb1bf7841b%2F180911-marijuana-editorial.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/static/img/usn-logo-large.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b34d31c/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F6a%2F3f3fa241479aa1accecb1bf7841b%2F180911-marijuana-editorial.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usnews.com/news/health-care-news/articles/2018-09-11/study-medical-marijuana-relieves-range-of-symptoms-with-no-serious-side-effects", "title": "Study: Medical Marijuana Relieves Range of Symptoms With No Serious Side Effects", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "People suffering from a variety of health conditions experienced a reduction in the severity of their symptoms after consuming marijuana.", "keywords": "Alexa Lardieri,marijuana,medical marijuana,health,University of New Mexico,Health News,National News", "site": "news", "zone": "home/articles", "fb": {"pages": 5834919267, "app_id": 130063997038366}, "og": {"title": "Medical Marijuana Relieves Range of Symptoms With No Serious Side Effects, Studies Find", "description": "People suffering from a variety of health conditions experienced a reduction in the severity of their symptoms after consuming marijuana.", "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b34d31c/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F6a%2F3f3fa241479aa1accecb1bf7841b%2F180911-marijuana-editorial.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/health-care-news/articles/2018-09-11/study-medical-marijuana-relieves-range-of-symptoms-with-no-serious-side-effects"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b34d31c/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F6a%2F3f3fa241479aa1accecb1bf7841b%2F180911-marijuana-editorial.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@USNews", "title": "Medical Marijuana Relieves Range of Symptoms With No Serious Side Effects, Studies Find", "description": "People suffering from a variety of health conditions experienced a reduction in the severity of their symptoms after consuming marijuana."}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "optimizely": "Optimizely is supported by this application but is not enabled for this page."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536638400.0, "source": "https://www.usnews.com", "summary": ""}
