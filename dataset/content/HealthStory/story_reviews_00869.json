Of the study participants who expressed a preference, 62 percent said they preferred the prep-free CT procedure over the colonoscopy.\n\nOnly sixty percent of Americans age 50 and over get the American Cancer Society\u2019s recommended screening for colon cancer: a colonoscopy every 10 years, fecal occult blood test every year, or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or barium enema imaging every five years. Surveys suggest that patients find the prep -- required for both colonoscopy and traditional virtual colonoscopy -- to be the worst part of screening.\n\n\u201cA number of folks, who currently aren\u2019t being screened because they fear the prep or aren\u2019t willing to go through it again, may be willing to have screening if they\u2019re told they don\u2019t need to take laxatives and can still get a potent test,\u201d said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colon cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nAbout 49,000 Americans die every year from colon cancer, added Brooks, and at least half of those deaths could be prevented if everyone followed the screening recommendations.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy, with or without prep, has some limitations. About one in five patients must undergo a standard colonoscopy after the imaging procedure to have suspicious looking polyps snipped off and biopsied. The CT scan also delivers a dose of radiation that -- while only one-fifth of the dose of an abdominal CT scan -- was significant enough to raise the flags of the US Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nThe government advisory group decided in 2008 not to recommend the use of virtual colonoscopy, saying that evidence wasn\u2019t sufficient enough to prove that the test\u2019s benefits outweighed its harms, which include a dose of radiation with every screening test.\n\n(Standard colonoscopy also has rare complications such as an adverse reaction to the sedative, perforation to the colon, and bleeding from the site where the polyp was taken.)\n\nMedicare doesn\u2019t provide coverage for the imaging test, which Zalis said costs about one-third as much as the traditional scope screening.\n\nTraditional colonscopy also trumps the virtual test when is comes to detecting smaller polyps, less than 10 millimeters in size. The new study found that virtual colonosopy detected only 70 percent of polyps under 8 millimeters in size, compared with 88 percent detected by a scope. What\u2019s not clear, though, is whether missing these smaller polyps will make a difference in terms of catching growths before they turn into cancer.\n\n\u201cStudies are underway right now,\u201d said Brooks, \u201cto track these smaller lesions, to see what happens to them.\u201d\n\nDeborah Kotz can be reached at dkotz@globe.com.
