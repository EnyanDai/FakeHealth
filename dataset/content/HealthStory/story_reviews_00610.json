While the more aggressive treatment was better at preventing recurrence of tumors in the brain, it didn\u2019t extend survival.\n\n\u201cThe potential benefits of whole brain radiation therapy are far outweighed by the detriments of the therapy itself,\u201d said Paul Brown, professor of radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. The \u201cnegative impact\u201d on cognitive function \u201cwas more than I would have expected.\u201d\n\nDr. Brown is lead author of the study which was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The study involved 213 patients who had one to three small tumors, or metastases in the brain. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nBrain metastases is a common problem in cancer affecting an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients annually in the U.S. alone, some 200,000 of whom get whole brain radiation during the course of their disease. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy to spread to the brain, followed by breast cancer and melanoma.\n\nWhole brain radiation was first used in 1954 and has long been a standard strategy for brain metastases, said Andrew Lassman, chief of neuro-oncology at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Though doctors have curbed its use in recent years amid concerns over its deleterious effect on cognitive function, whether the treatment or recurrence of metastases is worse for the patient has remained controversial, he said.\n\nWhole brain radiation is typically administered in 10 20-minute treatments given over two weeks while radiosurgery, in which radiation is delivered in a powerful, focused beam with instruments known by such names as the gammaknife, is a longer procedure given in a single day.\n\nFor the study, patients were randomly assigned to either radiosurgery followed by whole brain radiation or radiosurgery alone. Patients then underwent seven cognitive tests three months after treatment and at several subsequent intervals.\n\nPatients treated with both approaches performed significantly worse three months later on tests involving immediate recall of words, delayed recall and measures of verbal communication. Patients given both treatments also scored lower on a quality of life questionnaire, Dr. Brown said. Median overall survival was 7.5 months for those receiving both treatments and 10.7 months for those on radiosurgery alone, a result considered statistically about the same.\n\nThe study will \u201cpush the use of whole-brain radiation therapy more toward the latter portion of the patient\u2019s course, when they have no more good viable options,\u201d Dr. Brown said.\n\nThe new report is \u201cthe most comprehensive study that lets us quantify the risk/benefit\u201d of the treatment, said Brian M. Alexander, a radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston.\n\nDr Lassman said the findings conflict with some other studies. He said patients for whom brain metastases rather than their primary cancer pose the biggest threat to survival, for instance, may benefit from whole-brain radiation.\n\nDr. Lassman added that both whole brain radiation and recurrent metastases are \u201cbad for the brain.\u201d\n\nHe said researchers are studying alternate approaches, including irradiating the brain while shielding the hippocampus, a component of the brain critical to memory, and giving certain drugs used to treat dementia that may protect the brain against the effects of radiation.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at
