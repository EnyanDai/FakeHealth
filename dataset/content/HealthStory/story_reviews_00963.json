When inflamed, discs press against nearby nerves. People with this condition can experience pain, numbness, and weakness in the back, buttocks, and legs.\n\nNone of the people in this study had been helped by other nonsurgical therapies, and supporters say the new therapy could become a standard treatment for such patients. But a back pain specialist who spoke to WebMD says that further research is needed.\n\nIn the study, 119 people (37%) reported no pain at six months. About another third reported less frequent episodes of low back pain, \"maybe once a day,\" says researcher Thomas Lehnert, MD, an assistant professor of radiology at Frankfurt University in Germany.\n\nAnother 22% reported only a little improvement, with pain persisting. And 7% had no improvement or their pain got worse. A few patients resorted to back surgery.\n\nStill, ozone therapy could even help many patients with unrelenting back pain to avoid surgery, Lehnert tells WebMD. Before the treatment, patients had tried everything without success and were considering an operation, he says.\n\nStudies suggest that ozone therapy works by reducing inflammation, shrinking herniated discs, and relieving pressure on the nerves bringing pain signals to the brain. The steroid further reduces inflammation.\n\nLehnert presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.", "images":
