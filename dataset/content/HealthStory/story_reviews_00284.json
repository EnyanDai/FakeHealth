But when the Toronto-based artist and mother puts on a new kind of camera-equipped headgear, she looks at me like no one has before.\n\nThe visor that allows legally blind people to see is no longer Star Trek fiction. Leaps in augmented-reality technology are being used to help people with severely low vision gain back enough sight to function, and then some.\n\nMs. Felix, who has Stargardt disease, wears a device from a company called eSight. The eSight 3\u2014which weighs less than a quarter of a pound and is operated by hand-held remote\u2014captures the world through a camera system and then displays it on OLED screens that sit very close to the eyes. Legally blind people like Ms. Felix have some limited vision, and eSight\u2019s displays are tuned to make use of it. By dialing up contrast and allowing users to zoom in, it can dramatically amplify sight without a surgical procedure.\n\n\u201cBeing able to see that people\u2019s pupils actually dilate and contract is quite amazing,\u201d she says. The gear has allowed Ms. Felix to get a desk job and travel on her own. She\u2019s also become a spokeswoman for eSight.\n\nEfforts to make noninvasive vision tech started decades ago with bulky TV-like devices that magnify and increase the contrast on books. In the 1990s, NASA developed space goggles with a camera and two black-and-white cathode-ray-tube screens.\n\nTo Star Trek fans, this system recalls the blind \u201cNext Generation\u201d series character who wore a vision visor. \u201cI remember thinking that Geordi La Forge was my hero and that one day there would be something like that and when it came out, I wanted to try it,\u201d says Ms. Felix, who is 36.\n\nThe eSight visor, in development for 10 years, is reaching a level of maturity. The third-generation, which debuts this week, weighs less, has a wider field of view and just looks cooler. ESight\u2014along with other makers of head-mounted low-vision aids such as Orcam and Nu-Eyes\u2014is taking advantage of tech that is cheaper, smaller and faster because of popular gadgets like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.\n\nThe camera-equipped eSight 3, which weighs less than a quarter of a pound, uses VR-like displays to bring images close to the user's eyes.

The battery lasts about 6\u00bd hours.\n\nUsing the hand-held controller, users can zoom and pan, like on a street sign, or plug in a TV feed directly. Because of those capabilities, Ms. Felix said in some cases eSight probably lets her see better than me.\n\n\u201cThere is no device that\u2019s a magic solution for all problems,\u201d says Walter Wittich, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal\u2019s School of Optometry, who is part of the first independent research project into the tech. Still, Mr. Wittich says it can be useful for the people with low vision who benefit from magnification, for whom most current options are hand-held.\n\nNot everyone feels equally comfortable operating the gear. Mr. Wittich plans to release initial results from the study in May, and says one thing that is clear is that people who click with eSight immediately see a boost in quality of life. \u201cIt is working very well for some people already, and there is still quite a bit of potential in both the design and electronic capability,\u201d he says.\n\nESight says its tech has worked for about three quarters of the people who have tried it. Their biggest hurdle is getting the technology paid for. They have sold about a thousand to date, and this new visor costs $10,000. While the device has FDA clearance as a Class I medical device, most insurance doesn\u2019t cover it.\n\n\u201cThat is a battle we are starting to wage,\u201d says eSight Chief Executive Brian Mech. Some employers and other third parties have picked up the tab, he says, but the challenge is to reach users who have limited resources because their vision challenges keep them from work.\n\nThe eSight 3 handheld controller lets the user zoom in or pan across signs and other objects. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cYes, that is an expensive piece of equipment, but it can really do a lot for people,\u201d says Gislin Dagnelie, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins and an adviser to the company. While the National Federation of the Blind estimates there are 1.3 million legally blind people living in the U.S., Mr. Dagnelie thinks at least a hundred thousand people could benefit from eSight\u2019s tech.\n\nFor an artist like Ms. Felix, it has offered more than routine improvement. She worked for decades in sculpture and thick paint, because she felt her work as much as she saw it. Her favorite artist was Vincent van Gogh, because he also likely suffered from vision problems.\n\nShe recalls the first time she saw \u201cStarry Night\u201d with her eSight visor on, it made her cry. \u201cI saw every little stroke. When I saw the color mixtures and how thick the paint was, it was the most overwhelming moment of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought that never in my life would I be able to see something so beautiful.\u201d\n\nWrite to Geoffrey A.
