A third had a strong anti-tumor response, and his cancer remains in check. The research group plans to treat four more patients with CLL before moving into a larger Phase II trial.\n\n\u201cWe put a key onto the surface of the T-cells that fits into a lock that only the cancer cells have,\u201d said Dr. Michael Kalos, director of translational and correlative studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Perelman School of Medicine and an investigator on the study.\n\nThe results provide \u201ca tumor-attack roadmap for the treatment of other cancers,\u201d including those of the lung and ovaries as well as myeloma and melanoma, researchers said.\n\nThe findings were published simultaneously Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine and Science Translational Medicine.\n\nKalos said past efforts to use the technique, known as \u201cadoptive T-cell transfer,\u201d failed either because the T-cell response was too weak or proved too toxic for normal tissue.\n\nNEW METHODOLOGY\n\nThe technique differs from other cancer therapies designed to harness the body\u2019s own immune system to fight tumors \u2014 such as therapeutic cancer vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe are saying forget about stimulating an immune response. We are going to give you an immune response,\u201d Kalos said.\n\nThe treatment appears safe, but researchers said more study was needed. The leukemia patients in the Phase I trial had to be treated with an immunity-boosting drug since the targeted molecule, CD-19, is also present on certain normal immune-system cells.\n\nTo deliver the gene therapy, the researchers used a virus that can only infect cells once. It was used to carry a chimeric antigen receptor targeting CD-19 coupled with receptors for two other components of T-cell activity.\n\nAbout two weeks after the gene therapy, patients began to experience \u201ctumor lysis syndrome\u201d \u2014 chills, nausea and fever \u2014 caused by the break-down products of dying cancer cells.\n\nThe engineered T-cells were detected in patients\u2019 blood for several months afterward, and a portion of them turned into \u201cmemory T-cells,\u201d which could provide ongoing protection against cancer recurrence, researchers surmised.\n\nDr. Walter Urba of the Providence Cancer Center in Portland Oregon cautioned that continued presence of activated T-cells and memory cells might be more of a problem in other types of cancer where toxic effects on normal tissue could be more severe.\n\nIn addition, the long-term viability of the treatment is still unknown.\n\n\u201cOne of the big questions is ... will those persistent T-cells continue to work and prevent that tumor from coming back,\u201d said Urba, who was not involved in the study.\n\nAll of the funding for the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s gene therapy work has come from the academic community, but the work is expensive.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for corporate partners as we head into Phase II trials,\u201d Kalos said.\n\nFurther study will show whether the latest results \u201creflect an authentic advance toward a clinically applicable and effective therapy or yet another promising lead that runs into a barrier that cannot be easily overcome,\u201d Urba said in an NEJM editorial.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png",
