accuracy of over 75% by analyzing samples of their breath.\n\nDec. 5, 2012 -- A breath test similar to the one used to determine when a driver has had too much to drink shows promise as a screening tool for cancer .\n\nCancer Breath Test\n\nSimilar research is under way to develop breathalyzer-like devices to detect lung, breast, prostate, and other cancers.\n\nCleveland Clinic pulmonologist Peter Mazzone, MD, who is conducting lung cancer studies, says a breath test for cancer may be a reality in as little as five years if all goes well.\n\n\u201cBut we are still in the research phase, and there is still the possibility that this technology will never prove clinically useful,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is still quite a bit of work to be done.\u201d\n\nMazzone says the breath functions in the body in much the same way that the exhaust system functions in a car, and what comes out gives a sense of how things are working inside.\n\nA person\u2019s breath contains a variety of chemical compounds, and it has long been recognized that certain illnesses can affect how the breath smells.\n\nPeople with poorly controlled diabetes, for example, may have breath that smells fruity due to an overproduction of chemicals called ketones; people with kidney or liver failure can have fishy breath.\n\nThe lung cancer device Mazzone is testing, called an \"electronic nose\" sensor, changes color based on the chemicals in the breath.", "images":
