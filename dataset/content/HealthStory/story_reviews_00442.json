Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.\n\nBut out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called \u201cresistant starch,\u201d suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.\n\nWhen we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them\u2014which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they\u2019re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics\u2014food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.\n\n\u201cCertain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,\u201d says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. \u201cIn my belief, that\u2019s what\u2019s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.\u201d\n\nLuckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.\n\nGetty Images; Illustration by Marisa Gertz for TIME\n\nMost intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. \u201cCooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,\u201d Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. \u201cThe ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,\u201d Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.\n\nIn all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a Nutrition Journal study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant\u2014much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.\n\nGet The Brief.

To Arciero\u2019s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. \u201cAfter you eat a meal that\u2019s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,\u201d he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found\u2014which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. \u201cIf you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that\u2019s a pretty powerful combination,\u201d Arciero says.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people lose weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. \u201cThe potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don\u2019t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,\u201d Arciero says\u2014especially when it\u2019s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.\n\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/hamburgers-and-fries.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/soda-can-drink-diet-health-fitness.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/healthy-and-filling-barley.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/carbs-group.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/healthy-and-filling-barley.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mandy Oaklander"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/collection/guide-to-weight-loss/4318201/carbohydrates-weight-loss-resistant-starch", "title": "Carbohydrates and Resistant Starch May Help Weight Loss", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "carb,carbohydrate,carbohydrates,Carbs,diet,Diet/Nutrition,Food Facts,good carbs,low-carb diet,potato starch,resistant starch,starch,starches,Weight loss,what are carbohydrates,what are carbs", "news_keywords": "diet, carbs, carb, carbohydrate, carbohydrates, starch, starches, resistant starch, weight loss, good carbs, what are carbs, potato starch, low carb diet, what are carbohydrates", "description": "Resistant starch is a kind of carbohydrate found in unripe bananas, white rice and pasta, and this carb may help you maintain body weight", "og": {"title": "This Kind of Carb Won't Make You Gain Weight", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4318201/carbohydrates-weight-loss-resistant-starch/", "description": "Unripe bananas and takeout white rice both have it", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/healthy-and-filling-barley.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/collection/guide-to-weight-loss/4318201/carbohydrates-weight-loss-resistant-starch", "description": "Resistant starch is a kind of carbohydrate found in unripe bananas, white rice and pasta, and this carb may help you maintain body weight", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/healthy-and-filling-barley.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4318201/carbohydrates-weight-loss-resistant-starch/", "title": "This Kind of Carb Won't Make You Gain Weight", "description": "Unripe bananas and takeout white rice both have it", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/healthy-and-filling-barley.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
