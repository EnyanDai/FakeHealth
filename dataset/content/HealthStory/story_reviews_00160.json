One of medicine\u2019s greatest villains: HIV.\n\nThe patients were children who had inherited a mutated gene causing a rare disorder, adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD. Nerve cells in the brain die, and in a few short years, children lose the ability to walk or talk.\n\nThey become unable to eat without a feeding tube, to see, hear or think. They usually die within five years of diagnosis.\n\nThe disease strikes about one in 20,000 boys; symptoms first occur at an average age of 7. The only treatment is a bone-marrow transplant \u2014 if a compatible donor can be found \u2014 or a transplant with cord blood, if it was saved at birth.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/06/science/06GENES1/06GENES1-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/06/science/06GENES1/06GENES1-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/06/science/06GENES1/06GENES1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/health/gene-therapy-brain-disease.html", "title": "In a First, Gene Therapy Halts a Fatal Brain Disease", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-10-05T22:10:17.000Z", "modified": "2017-10-06T05:32:49.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata", "tag": "Clinical Trials", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005478405, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/37ceb9e8-ee65-5f79-9abc-af56f0cf4981", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/2589f221b5fe4d63bbfb6f991a151155", "description": "With a disabled AIDS virus, doctors supply a gene to boys with a degenerative neural condition.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/06/science/06GENES1/06GENES1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Gina Kolata", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/06/science/06GENES1/06GENES1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Brain,Genetics and Heredity,Stem cell,Adrenoleukodystrophy,Clinical trial", "pdate": 20171005, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/health/gene-therapy-brain-disease.html", "type": "article", "title": "In a First, Gene Therapy Halts a Fatal Brain Disease", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/06/science/06GENES1/06GENES1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Brandon Rojas, left, who has ALD, with his mother, Liliana, and father, Paul Rojas, in their home in Dover Plains, N.Y.
