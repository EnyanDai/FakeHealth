And because it has few side effects, researchers are studying whether light therapy can help with depression during pregnancy and be used to treat elderly people with dementia. It is also being investigated for the treatment of bulimia nervosa, severe premenstrual syndrome and even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.\n\nThough randomized controlled clinical trials of bright light are difficult to do properly \u2014 one expert is fond of saying that it is difficult to \u201cblind\u201d studies of bright light \u2014 the American Psychiatric Association considers bright-light therapy an effective low-risk treatment for both S.A.D. and nonseasonal major depressive disorder.\n\nA 2006 multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial that compared bright-light therapy head to head with the popular antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) in 96 subjects found the two treatments equally effective for alleviating winter depression, though light produced results faster, usually within a week, and with fewer side effects.\n\nWhy, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don\u2019t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. Moreover, \u201cdoctors are just more comfortable prescribing medication, because that\u2019s what they do for everything,\u201d Dr. Lewy said.\n\nPhoto\n\nSome patients who suffer from chronic depression say they use light therapy in addition to their regular medication in the winter months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always seen a drastic change in my personality from spring and summer to fall and winter, and it got worse as I got older,\u201d said Rick Bach, 54, a painter who owns a hair salon in West Hartford, Conn., and tries to spend every January in Puerto Rico.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him. \u201cIt can help you from falling into a deep depression, but it won\u2019t help you climb out of one,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Light also has an effect on hormones, the body\u2019s chemical messengers, affecting the brain\u2019s hypothalamus, which is involved in regulating mood, energy and appetite.\n\n\u201cThe hormone melatonin, which is secreted at night, can be suppressed by light,\u201d Dr. Rosenthal said. \u201cStudies have also shown that light influences serotonin and epinephrine pathways in the brain, the same neurotransmitter systems known to be affected in people with general depression.\u201d\n\nBut while part of the appeal of light therapy is that it can be self-prescribed, using a light box is not as simple as it may appear. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting treatment to rule out other medical conditions and to help with monitoring and adjusting bright-light exposure.\n\nSome patients may want to try simply getting more natural light to help with seasonal mood changes \u2014 getting out as much as possible during the brightest time of day in the winter, sitting near windows during the day or taking vacations to sunny locales in the winter.\n\nIf you choose to try light therapy, here are a few tips from experts.\n\nCOSTS Light boxes can be purchased for about $200 online; they are also available for rent. Some patients manage to get insurance reimbursement by having a doctor write a letter, but don\u2019t count on your policy covering it.\n\nPRECAUTIONS Side effects include headaches and hypomania, though experts say these are rare. Face the light but do not stare at the light. If you have an eye condition of any kind, clear light therapy with your ophthalmologist first.\n\nMORE INFORMATION Check the Web sites of the Society for Light Therapy and Biological Rhythms at www.sltbr.org and Center for Environmental Therapeutics at www.cet.org.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/15/science/15CONS/15CONS-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/15/science/15CONS/15CONS-thumbStandard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/15/science/15CONS/15CONS-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roni Caryn Rabin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/health/policy/light-boxes-may-help-melt-those-winter-blues.html", "title": "Light Boxes May Help Melt Those Winter Blues", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001170934", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/health/policy/light-boxes-may-help-melt-those-winter-blues.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/health/policy/light-boxes-may-help-melt-those-winter-blues.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001170934"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/health/policy/light-boxes-may-help-melt-those-winter-blues.html", "title": "Light Boxes May Help Melt Those Winter Blues", "description": "Bright-light therapy is the treatment of choice for many Americans who suffer the winter blues, but many experts say it is underused.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "A Portable Glow to Help Melt Those Winter Blues", "description": "Bright-light therapy is the treatment of choice for many Americans who suffer the winter blues, but many experts say it is underused.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 100000001170934, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Light Boxes May Help Melt Those Winter Blues", "col": "The Consumer", "pdate": 20111114, "utime": 20140831102146, "ptime": 20111114161245, "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 14, 2011", "dat": "Nov. 14, 2011", "lp": "Bright-light therapy is the treatment of choice for many Americans who suffer the winter blues, but many experts say it is underused.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "15consumer", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/policy/index.jsonp", "published": "2011-11-14T16:12:45-05:00", "modified": "2014-08-31T10:21:46-04:00", "section": "Money & Policy", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin", "tag": "Light"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/policy/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/health/policy/light-boxes-may-help-melt-those-winter-blues.html", "type": "article", "title": "Light Boxes May Help Melt Those Winter Blues", "description": "Bright-light therapy is the treatment of choice for many Americans who suffer the winter blues, but many experts say it is underused.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/15/science/15CONS/15CONS-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Roni Caryn Rabin", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By RONI CARYN RABIN", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "policy", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Light", "keywords": "Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD),Mental Health and Disorders,Winter (Season),Depression (Mental),Medicine and Health,Ultraviolet Light,Light", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/15/science/15CONS/15CONS-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/policy", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1321333200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
