REUTERS/Nacho Doce\n\nThe study, of 123 middle-aged and older adults, found that those who added yoga classes to standard diabetes care shed a handful of pounds over three months. Meanwhile, their average blood sugar levels held steady \u2014 in contrast to the non-yoga-practicing \u201ccontrol\u201d group, whose blood sugar levels rose.\n\nThe findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not suggest that yoga should replace other forms of exercise for people with type 2 diabetes \u2014 a disease commonly associated with obesity.\n\nTo really lose weight and rein in blood sugar, more-vigorous exercise would work better, according to Shreelaxmi V. Hegde of the Srinivas Institute of Medical Science and Research Center in Mangalore, India.\n\nAmong the 60 study participants who took yoga classes several times a week, the average BMI \u2014 a measure of weight in relation to height \u2014 declined from 25.9 to 25.4. A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight.\n\n\u201cIn our study the effect of yoga on BMI (body mass index) and blood sugar control was marginal,\u201d Hegde, the lead researcher on the work, told Reuters Health in an email.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cit should be noted that yoga controlled the blood sugar levels which otherwise rose in the control group.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that, the study found, signs of so-called oxidative stress declined in the yoga group.\n\nOxidative stress refers to a situation where levels of reactive oxygen species or \u201cfree radicals\u201d \u2014 damaging byproducts of energy use in cells \u2014 rise beyond the body\u2019s capacity to neutralize them. Long-term oxidative stress is believed to contribute to a host of chronic diseases.\n\nIn this study, Hegde\u2019s team measured participants\u2019 blood levels of certain chemicals that reflect oxidative stress. They found that, on average, the yoga group\u2019s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent.\n\nThe significance of that is not clear. Hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time, it might lower the chances of diabetes complications, which include heart and kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes.\n\nFurther, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say.\n\nAccording to Hegde, yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system \u2014 the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system.\n\nThere are caveats. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.\n\nIn the real world, yoga classes vary widely. Some are vigorous work-outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions.\n\nOlder adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions. In the U.S., hospitals and local community centers are increasingly offering such classes.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qJGXZ4 Diabetes Care, online August 11, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110902&t=2&i=491888178&r=2011-09-02T161905Z_01_BTRE78119C600_RTROPTP_0_BRAZIL&w=20", "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110902&t=2&i=491888178&w=1200&r=2011-09-02T161905Z_01_BTRE78119C600_RTROPTP_0_BRAZIL"], "top_img": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110902&t=2&i=491888178&w=1200&r=2011-09-02T161905Z_01_BTRE78119C600_RTROPTP_0_BRAZIL", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Norton", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yoga-diabetes-idUSTRE7814FL20110902", "title": "Yoga shows some benefit for diabetes", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Gentle yoga classes may help people with type 2 diabetes take off a small amount of weight and steady their blood sugar control, a small study suggests.", "Author": "Amy Norton", "keywords": "US,YOGA,DIABETES", "news_keywords": "US;YOGA;DIABETES", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Sep 02 16:19:12 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-09-02T16:19:12+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Amy Norton", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yoga-diabetes-idUSTRE7814FL20110902", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Yoga shows some benefit for diabetes", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,YOGA,DIABETES", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-YOGA-DIABETES", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Yoga shows some benefit for diabetes", "sailthru.author": "Amy Norton", "sailthru.date": "2011-09-02T16:19:12+0000", "sailthru.title": "Yoga shows some benefit for diabetes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Yoga shows some benefit for diabetes", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-yoga-diabetes-idUSTRE7814FL20110902", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Gentle yoga classes may help people with type 2 diabetes take...", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110902&t=2&i=491888178&w=1200&r=2011-09-02T161905Z_01_BTRE78119C600_RTROPTP_0_BRAZIL", "article": {"published_time": "2011-09-02T16:19:12+0000", "modified_time": "2011-09-02T16:19:12+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Amy Norton", "tag": "US,YOGA,DIABETES"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Yoga shows some benefit for diabetes", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Gentle yoga classes may help people with type 2 diabetes take off a small amount of weight and steady their blood sugar control, a small study suggests.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110902&t=2&i=491888178&w=1200&r=2011-09-02T161905Z_01_BTRE78119C600_RTROPTP_0_BRAZIL", "src": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20110902&t=2&i=491888178&w=1200&r=2011-09-02T161905Z_01_BTRE78119C600_RTROPTP_0_BRAZIL"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1314936000.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
