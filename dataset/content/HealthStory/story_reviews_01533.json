But robotic surgeries took longer than non-robotic surgeries by about 40 minutes - 3 hours and 11 minutes compared to 2 hours and 29 minutes, on average. Longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong.\n\nThe robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one.\n\nSurgical robots do not operate on their own. Rather, surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body, while they watch a three-dimensional image of what\u2019s going on inside. One robot can cost around $1.5 million.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,\u201d the authors write.\n\nHowever, they suggest that more complicated procedures for severe endometriosis, which might require open surgery, would benefit from the help of a robot.\n\nInexperienced doctors might also take advantage of the robot for surgery if they don\u2019t think they have the skills to do the surgery with only a small cut, Dr. Nezhat said. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one.\n\nDr. Tommaso Falcone, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Cleveland Clinic, said this study shows that more technology is not always better. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cI just need a calculator to add a few things,\u201d said Falcone, who was not involved in the study. \u201cYes it\u2019s true that if I\u2019ve got that supercomputer maybe it looks better. But all I need to do is add 5 and 5.\u201d\n\nEspecially in a time of concern over rising medical costs, \u201cwe should not simply use the highly sophisticated technology just because it\u2019s there,\u201d Falcone said.\n\nSOURCE: here\n\nFertility and Sterility, online May 26, 2010.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Genevra Pittman", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-endometriosis-surgery-idUSTRE65E5PQ20100615", "title": "Endometriosis?
