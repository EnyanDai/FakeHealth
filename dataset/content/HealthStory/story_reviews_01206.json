The cause of the disease is unknown, and the risk of developing it increases with age.\n\n\"This is the first study in humans to examine the association between flavonoids and risk of developing Parkinson's disease ,\" says researcher Xiang Gao, MD, PhD, of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, in a news release. \"Our findings suggest that flavonoids, specifically a group called anthocyanins, may have neuroprotective effects. If confirmed, flavonoids may be a natural and healthy way to reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease .\"\n\nA new study shows men who ate the most foods rich in a group of antioxidants known as flavonoids were 35% less likely to develop Parkinson\u2019s disease than those who ate the least. Major dietary sources of flavonoids include berries, apples, tea, red wine, chocolate , and citrus fruits.\n\nFeb. 14, 2011 -- Incorporating berries and other fruits in your diet may pay off by reducing the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\nBerries Blunt Parkinson\u2019s Disease Risk\n\nThe study, to be presented in April at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Honolulu, looked at the relationship between flavonoid intake and Parkinson\u2019s disease in 49,281 men who participated in the Health Professional Follow-up Study and 80,336 women who participated in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study.\n\nThe participants were followed for 20-22 years and filled out questionnaires about the foods they ate.\n\nResearchers calculated total flavonoid intake based on the participants\u2019 consumption of five flavonoid-rich foods included on the questionnaires: tea, berries, apples, red wine, and oranges/orange juice.\n\nThe results showed that men who ate the most foods rich in flavonoids had a 35% lower risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease compared with those who ate the least. No link between overall flavonoid consumption and Parkinson\u2019s disease risk was found in women.\n\nBut when researchers looked at specific sub-groups of flavonoids, they found both men and women who ate the most foods rich in anthocyanins, which are found primarily in berries and apples, had a 22% lower risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease compared to those who ate the least.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t prove that berries (or flavonoids in any other food) prevent Parkinson\u2019s disease. This was an observational study and therefore can\u2019t establish cause and effect. Nor is it clear why the results differed for men and women.\n\nThis study will be presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the \"peer review\" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.",
