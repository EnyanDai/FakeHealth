REUTERS/Nikola Solic\n\nResearchers studying more than 33,000 Swedish women found that the more chocolate women said they ate, the lower their risk of stroke.\n\nThe results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren\u2019t a free pass to gorge on chocolate.\n\n\u201cGiven the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it\u2019s chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,\u201d Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nWhile she believes chocolate has health benefits, she also warned that eating too much of it could be counterproductive.\n\n\u201cChocolate should be consumed in moderation as it is high in calories, fat, and sugar,\u201d she said. \u201cAs dark chocolate contains more cocoa and less sugar than milk chocolate, consumption of dark chocolate would be more beneficial.\u201d\n\nLarsson and her colleagues, whose findings appear in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, tapped into data from a mammography study that included self-reports of how much chocolate women ate in 1997. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 years.\n\nOver the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk.\n\nAmong those with the highest weekly chocolate intake \u2014 more than 45 grams \u2014 there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year. That figure was 7.8 per 1,000 among women who ate the least (less than 8.9 grams per week).\n\nScientists speculate that substances known as flavonoids, in particular so-called flavanols, may be responsible for chocolate\u2019s apparent effects on health.\n\nAccording to Larsson, flavonoids have been shown to cut high blood pressure, a risk factor for stroke, and improve other blood factors linked to heart health. Whether that theoretical benefit translates into real-life benefits remains to be proven by rigorous studies, however.\n\nNearly 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year, with about a sixth of them dying of it and many more left disabled. For those at high risk, doctors recommend blood pressure medicine, quitting smoking, exercising more and eating a healthier diet \u2014 but so far chocolate isn\u2019t on the list.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qhsaZ0 Journal of the American College of Cardiology, October 10, 2011.", "images": ["http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20111010&t=2&i=513807881&r=BTRE7991O5600&w=20", "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20111010&t=2&i=513807881&w=1200&r=BTRE7991O5600", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20111010&t=2&i=513807881&w=1200&r=BTRE7991O5600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chocolate-strokes-idUSTRE7995O620111010", "title": "Chocolate lovers have fewer strokes, study finds", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn't necessarily bad for your health-- at least not when it comes to chocolate, hints a new study.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "Christine Scholtes Covic,Nikola Solic,US,CHOCOLATE,STROKES", "news_keywords": "Christine Scholtes Covic;Nikola Solic;US;CHOCOLATE;STROKES", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Oct 10 21:39:06 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-10-10T21:39:06+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chocolate-strokes-idUSTRE7995O620111010", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Chocolate lovers have fewer strokes, study finds", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Christine Scholtes Covic,Nikola Solic,US,CHOCOLATE,STROKES", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CHOCOLATE-STROKES", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Chocolate lovers have fewer strokes, study finds", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2011-10-10T21:39:06+0000", "sailthru.title": "Chocolate lovers have fewer strokes, study finds", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Chocolate lovers have fewer strokes, study finds", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-chocolate-strokes-idUSTRE7995O620111010", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn't necessarily bad for your health-- at...", "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20111010&t=2&i=513807881&w=1200&r=BTRE7991O5600", "article": {"published_time": "2011-10-10T21:39:06+0000", "modified_time": "2011-10-10T21:39:06+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "Christine Scholtes Covic,Nikola Solic,US,CHOCOLATE,STROKES"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chocolate lovers have fewer strokes, study finds", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn't necessarily bad for your health-- at least not when it comes to chocolate, hints a new study.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20111010&t=2&i=513807881&w=1200&r=BTRE7991O5600", "src": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20111010&t=2&i=513807881&w=1200&r=BTRE7991O5600"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1318219200.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
