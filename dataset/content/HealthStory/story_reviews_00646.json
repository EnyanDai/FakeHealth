BRCA mutations cause about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers and 10 to 15 percent of ovarian cancers among white women in the United States. It is unclear how common the mutations are in other racial and ethnic groups.\n\n\u201cProphylactic removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes is strongly recommended in women before age 40 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers,\u201d said Dr. Susan Domchek, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Basser Research Center, which specializes in BRCA mutations. \u201cThere is no effective screening for ovarian cancer and too many women with advanced stage ovarian cancer die of their disease.\u201d\n\nWriting for The New York Times\u2019s Op-Ed page, Ms. Jolie Pitt, 39, said she had expected to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, a procedure called a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but that a cancer scare made her decide to undergo the procedure sooner. Her mother, aunt and grandmother died of cancer.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/us/25cancer-web/25cancer-web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/us/25cancer-web/25cancer-web-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/us/25cancer-web/25cancer-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pam Belluck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/science/experts-back-angelina-jolie-pitt-in-choices-for-cancer-prevention.html", "title": "Experts Back Angelina Jolie Pitt in Choices for Cancer Prevention", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-03-25T01:19:40.000Z", "modified": "2015-03-25T01:36:08.000Z", "section": "Science", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/pam-belluck", "tag": "Breast Cancer", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003591645, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/c9348a27-b433-540b-8e48-5221f3143aac", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/ce8fbfb3a5074ee1a68845948ffb91d1", "description": "The actress had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed because she carries a genetic mutation that increases the risk of ovarian cancer.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/us/25cancer-web/25cancer-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Pam Belluck", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/us/25cancer-web/25cancer-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie,,Ovarian cancer,Genetics and Heredity,Surgery,Breast cancer", "pdate": 20150324, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/science/experts-back-angelina-jolie-pitt-in-choices-for-cancer-prevention.html", "type": "article", "title": "Experts Back\u00a0Angelina Jolie Pitt in Choices for Cancer Prevention", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/us/25cancer-web/25cancer-web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Angelina Jolie"}, "description": "The actress had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed because she carries a genetic mutation that increases the risk of ovarian cancer."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/science/experts-back-angelina-jolie-pitt-in-choices-for-cancer-prevention.html", "title": "Experts Back\u00a0Angelina Jolie Pitt in Choices for Cancer Prevention", "description": "The actress had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed because she carries a genetic mutation that increases the risk of ovarian cancer.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/25/us/25cancer-web/25cancer-web-articleLarge.jpg", "alt": "Angelina Jolie"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003591645"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "science", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/science/experts-back-angelina-jolie-pitt-in-choices-for-cancer-prevention.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003591645", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/science/experts-back-angelina-jolie-pitt-in-choices-for-cancer-prevention.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/science/experts-back-angelina-jolie-pitt-in-choices-for-cancer-prevention.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1427256000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
