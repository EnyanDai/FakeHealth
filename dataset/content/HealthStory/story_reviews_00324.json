Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness.\n\nThe experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it\u2019s almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin \u2014 and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona.\n\nIf you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cSweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,\u201d said John A. Rogers, who directs Northwestern University\u2019s Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics and led the new research.\n\nToday\u2019s wearable technology helps people track their calories, activity and heart rate. A wearable biosensor would be \u201cradically different,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nFor simple fitness purposes, it could give an early warning that it\u2019s time to replenish electrolytes before someone starts to feel dehydrated. But eventually with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.\n\nRogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.\n\nHow it works: Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change color to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration\u2019s acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.\n\nTogether, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colors and interprets what they mean.\n\nIn two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers\u2019 team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches\u2019 performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today \u2014 taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory. For a more real-world test, the other 12 bicyclists wore the patches while competing in a long-distance outdoor race in Tucson.\n\nThe patches stayed in place and worked even in the challenging outdoor race, and the patches\u2019 biochemical test results agreed with the indoor bikers\u2019 conventional sweat tests, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\n\n\u201cIt seems really practical,\u201d said Stanford University chemical engineering professor Zhenan Bao, who also researches novel biomedical materials but wasn\u2019t involved with the sweat patch. By simply looking at a color change, \u201csuch a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao\u2019s colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors.\n\nRogers\u2019 sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours. While Wednesday\u2019s studies used an early version that analyzed sweat just once during the exercise, he\u2019s now testing a design capable of multiple measurements over time.\n\n\u2014 Lauran Neergaard", "images": ["https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sweat-Patch-Health-Tr_raff-1024x576.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sweat-Patch-Health-Tr_raff-645x645.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsletter-Logo-Images-DR.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/stat-logo.svg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/plugins/stat-lazy-load/images/330x400-00000000.png", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=46858&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=436331036555416&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sweat-Patch-Health-Tr_raff-1024x576.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Associated Press", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Sharon Begley", "Megan Thielking", "Elizabeth Preston"], "canonical_link": "https://www.statnews.com/2016/11/23/sweat-skin-patch/", "title": "Sweat it out!
