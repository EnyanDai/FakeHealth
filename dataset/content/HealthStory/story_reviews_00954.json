What we need to do now is to look at a larger study, to confirm that these initial results are valid,\u201d she added.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-menopause-dhea-sex-idUSTRE7BJ00A20111220", "title": "DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "A hormone called DHEA and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to help women who are going through menopause and could also give them better sex lives, a study found on Tuesday.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "Andrea Genazzani,Anna Fenton,US,MENOPAUSE,DHEA,SEX,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),Western Europe,Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Science,United Kingdom,Italy,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Diversified Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States", "news_keywords": "Andrea Genazzani;Anna Fenton;US;MENOPAUSE;DHEA;SEX;Health / Medicine;Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy);Western Europe;Europe;Living / Lifestyle;Science;United Kingdom;Italy;Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);Diversified Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Dec 20 00:04:00 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-12-20T00:04:00+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-menopause-dhea-sex-idUSTRE7BJ00A20111220", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Andrea Genazzani,Anna Fenton,US,MENOPAUSE,DHEA,SEX,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),Western Europe,Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Science,United Kingdom,Italy,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Diversified Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-MENOPAUSE-DHEA-SEX", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2011-12-20T00:04:00+0000", "sailthru.title": "DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-menopause-dhea-sex-idUSTRE7BJ00A20111220", "type": "article", "description": "A hormone called DHEA and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to h...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-12-20T00:04:00+0000", "modified_time": "2011-12-20T00:04:00+0000", "section": "companies-health", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "Andrea Genazzani,Anna Fenton,US,MENOPAUSE,DHEA,SEX,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),Western Europe,Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Science,United Kingdom,Italy,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Diversified Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "DHEA hormone may help women through menopause: study", "description": "A hormone called DHEA and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to help women who are going through menopause and could also give them better sex lives, a study found on Tuesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "companies-health -
