Thanks to that recommendation, which has influenced insurance company policies, annual pap tests are no longer the standard of care today\u2014 and I see that as a huge problem.\n\nFor one, the three- to five-year interval between screening tests for women ages 21 to 65 doesn\u2019t take into account the several risk factors that boost a woman\u2019s chance of developing cervical cancer, such as multiple sexual partners, a weakened immune system that occurs with smoking, and even oral contraceptive use for more than five years. For these women, there is a still a serious need for more frequent cervical cancer screening, but nowhere in the guidelines are these risk factors addressed. Unfortunately, the only risk factor that changes the recommended frequency of screening is an abnormal pap result in the past.\n\nADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT\n\nI watched a 28-year-old woman die of cervical cancer during my OB-GYN residency, and it was horrible. I don\u2019t see why major medical organizations have made a recommendation that puts women at risk of a cancer that can be so easily prevented\u2014 and frankly, I see it as more of an economic decision than anything else.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what this means: Let\u2019s say you have multiple sexual partners and during a visit to your gynecologist, this information flies under the radar for whatever reason. (A woman with multiple sexual partners has a greater chance of acquiring HPV, the virus that causes most cervical cancers.) By the same token, no one brings up the issue of your partner\u2019s number of partners. And by the way, you can never be 100 percent positive that your partner is monogamous\u2014 no one can! The greater the number of partners he has, the greater his risk of contracting HPV and passing it to you. So you aren\u2019t given cervical cancer screening that day when, in fact, many doctors would agree that you need it.\n\nAnother problem I have with the current guidelines is this: New recommendations published last summer in the Annals of Internal Medicine advised physicians to stop offering routine pelvic exams to asymptomatic, average-risk women. I find this outrageous. Pelvic exams allow your physician to inspect the vulva for changes, and even feel around the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes for any masses. The delay to diagnosis of vulvar cancer, specifically, is about 18 months. A gynecologist is trained to detect early changes, and then do a biopsy for anything suspicious. As a diagnostic and screening tool, the pelvic exam is vital.\n\nWhat makes all of this even worse: No more pelvic exams and infrequent paps mean women won\u2019t see their gynecologist as regularly, and they may miss opportunities to voice concerns related to their reproductive health. An annual well-woman visit with your gynecologist allows you to discuss your health status, sexual practices, contraception needs, and get a breast exam, among other things\u2014 so it\u2019s still important for you to go, even if you don\u2019t end up having a pap or pelvic exam.\n\nUltimately, when it comes to gynecological cancer screening tests, every woman has individual risk factors, so you should talk to your doctor about yours. If you fall into any of the high risk categories\u2014 you have multiple partners, you smoke or are otherwise immunocompromised, and you\u2019ve been on birth control pills for five years or more\u2014 you really should be screened at least every other year. If you\u2019re insurance denies to cover this, you should fight them on the basis of being at a higher risk.\n\nAnd always be sure to visit your gyno if you\u2019re having any sort of symptom, such as pelvic pain, irregular discharge, or sexual dysfunction\u2014 all of which can point to a more serious problem. In these cases, you should be given a pelvic exam at the very least.\n\nDr. Jennifer Landa is Chief Medical Officer of BodyLogicMD, the nation's largest franchise of physicians specializing in bioidentical hormone therapy.
