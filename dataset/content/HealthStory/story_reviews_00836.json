What\u2019s more, the hormone, which was provided free by the manufacturer in the study, today costs $700 for a single shot, Baker said.\n\nAn expert who wasn\u2019t involved in the research echoed the cautions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s potentially good news, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to the point where people should go out and start using it,\u201d said Dr. Ronald C. Petersen, who heads the Mayo Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nThe new study, published Monday in the Archives of Neurology, included 152 people aged 55 to 87. Sixty-six had \u201cmild cognitive impairment,\u201d which falls somewhere between normal forgetfulness and dementia.\n\nBaker said researchers have failed so far to come up with effective drugs to treat mild cognitive impairment, just as there is no known treatment to stave off the normal memory decline that comes with age.\n\nBut recent work by one of Baker\u2019s co-authors hints that nasal sprays with the hormone insulin may have a positive impact on memory in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease - although that\u2019s far from conclusive yet.\n\nGHRH, a hormone produced by the hypothalamus in the brain, is linked to the insulin system, but also has a host of other effects. It dwindles naturally with aging, which has been linked to declines in memory and executive function.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is supplement that hormone and it then will result in a whole cascade of effects that then restore an aging system to a younger system,\u201d said Baker.\n\nIn her study, people injected a synthetic version of GHRH or a placebo daily for five months. At the end, those who got the drug did better on psychological tests of executive function - whether or not they had mild cognitive impairment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the test differences will translate into real life, said Baker. One test, for instance, asked participants to name the color of a font - say, green - used to write the name of a different color - say, \u201cred\u201d. But Baker said people who got the hormone were more likely to report improvements in their ability to focus during the day.\n\nThe researchers found no serious side effects in the study, although people who got the hormone more often complained of symptoms like skin reactions and joint pain.\n\nStill, both Baker and Petersen said more work is needed to gauge the long-term consequences of GHRH injections. It\u2019s possible health problems could show up down the road, and the mental boost may be short-lived.\n\n\u201cIs it going to work in the long run and is it going to be safe? That is still unknown,\u201d said Petersen.\n\nBaker added that it\u2019s too early to say whether the hormone could play a role in thwarting the development of Alzheimer\u2019s, which may affect as many as five million Americans.\n\nStill, she said, \u201cThere are things we can all do to postpone (mental) decline.\u201d Keeping medical conditions such as diabetes under control and getting regular exercise are two examples.\n\n\u201cWe recommend commonly that people start exercising when they are having mild cognitive impairment,\u201d Baker said. \u201cOur work and others\u2019 has shown that exercise really does make a difference.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/MNucEu Archives of Neurology, online August 6, 2012.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/784b347e0b396a146b780d1fc552f9ce.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://in.reuters.com/article/us-hormone-mental-function-idINBRE8751BD20120806", "title": "Hormone boosts mental function in small study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "health", "DCSext.ChannelList": "health;everythingNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A small U.S. study suggests daily hormone injections may boost mental agility in older people with and without mild cognitive problems.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "L.
