Now, eight family members have joined the study, and Dr. Biesecker is searching for more.\n\nEven so, finding the tiny, troublemaking genetic glitches in the family\u2019s genes is an intimidating task. There are 30,000 genes in each person\u2019s DNA, and each gene is can be made up of a string of hundreds of DNA letters and can harbor variations.\n\nMost of the variations are meaningless. In the entire DNA \u2014 which contains genes and regions that control genes \u2014 there are six billion DNA letters to check. To figure out what DNA changes might be important, the researchers are comparing the DNA sequences of Rick Del Sontro and his family with those of others in the study, looking for genetic changes that occur in every member of the Del Sontro family who has heart disease but that are not generally found in healthy people.\n\nDr. Biesecker acknowledged that there was no guarantee of success. He and his colleagues know the gene mutation in the Del Sontro family must be rare. Otherwise, lots of people would have early heart disease but no obvious risk factors. To keep the focus on truly rare mutations, the researchers are excluding those that are present in both members of the Del Sontro family and 3 percent or more of the other study participants. That strategy alone, Dr. Biesecker said, has eliminated the vast majority of candidate genes.\n\nThe researchers are now searching for culprits among genes that remain \u2014 a search that could take years. Or the change might be in a poorly understood region of DNA that controls genes rather than in a gene itself. Researchers\u2019 ignorance of these control regions and what many of them do might doom the effort. So the researchers are hoping the Del Sontro family\u2019s heart disease is caused by a mutated gene.\n\n\u201cOur main job is to find the gene,\u201d Dr. Biesecker said.\n\nStill, Mr. Del Sontro is preparing for the worst. He has life insurance and long-term care insurance.\n\n\u201cI keep waiting for the day when I have shortness of breath,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen his heart disease was first diagnosed four and a half years ago, Mr. Del Sontro, now 50, told his cardiologist he wanted to run one more Bay to Breakers race, a century-old 12-kilometer race in San Francisco. His doctor told him absolutely not, saying, \u201cYou are the kind of guy we will read about who dies during the race of a massive heart attack.\u201d Mr. Del Sontro could still exercise, his cardiologist said, but no more than 45 minutes a day.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/13/health/heart/heart-articleLarge.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/13/science/video-genetic-heart-disease/video-genetic-heart-disease-videoSmall.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/13/health/heart/heart-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/13/health/heart/heart-articleLarge.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/health/seeking-clues-to-a-heart-killer-in-the-dna-binding-a-family.html", "title": "Seeking Clues to Heart Disease in DNA of an Unlucky Family", "meta_data": {"alternateTitle": "Seeking Clues to a Heart Killer in the DNA Binding a Family", "article": {"published": "2013-05-13T00:55:25.000Z", "modified": "2013-05-13T00:55:20.000Z", "section": "Health", "tag": "Series", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000002221692, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/f8d666b4-5616-549c-b0fb-de5c2d57c6e9", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/75812cd0e8f74410ad9778b82c634a09", "description": "Scientists are studying the DNA of the Del Sontro family for mutations or aberrations, hoping to see if genetics can explain why heart disease strikes apparently healthy people.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/13/health/heart/heart-articleLarge.jpg", "byl": "By Gina Kolata", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/13/health/heart/heart-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Heart,,Genetics and Heredity,Research,DNA,Science and Technology,", "pdate": 20130512, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/health/seeking-clues-to-a-heart-killer-in-the-dna-binding-a-family.html", "type": "article", "title": "Seeking Clues to Heart Disease in DNA of an Unlucky Family", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/13/health/heart/heart-articleLarge.jpg", "alt": "Rick Del Sontro keeps himself lean and watches his diet, but despite his efforts, he has heart disease like many in his family."}, "description": "Scientists are studying the DNA of the Del Sontro family for mutations or aberrations, hoping to see if genetics can explain why heart disease strikes apparently healthy people."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/health/seeking-clues-to-a-heart-killer-in-the-dna-binding-a-family.html", "title": "Seeking Clues to Heart Disease in DNA of an Unlucky Family", "description": "Scientists are studying the DNA of the Del Sontro family for mutations or aberrations, hoping to see if genetics can explain why heart disease strikes apparently healthy people.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/13/health/heart/heart-articleLarge.jpg", "alt": "Rick Del Sontro keeps himself lean and watches his diet, but despite his efforts, he has heart disease like many in his family."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002221692"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News,Series", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/health/seeking-clues-to-a-heart-killer-in-the-dna-binding-a-family.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002221692", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/health/seeking-clues-to-a-heart-killer-in-the-dna-binding-a-family.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/health/seeking-clues-to-a-heart-killer-in-the-dna-binding-a-family.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1368417600.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
