But none had evidence of cancer when biopsies were performed within six months of entering the trial.\n\nStudy researcher Gerald L. Andriole, MD, says a significant proportion of men screened for prostate cancer fall into this clinically ambiguous category of having elevated PSAs and negative biopsies.\n\n\"We know from experience that many of these men are likely to have microscopic prostate tumors that were missed by their original biopsy,\" he says in a news release.\n\nThe men were assigned to receive either placebo treatments or daily 0.5-milligram doses of Avodart for four years. Scheduled biopsies were performed two and four years after they entered the trial.", "images":
