Franks Jr., MD, of the NYU Langone Medical Center, says thalidomide is very effective for treating people with lupus skin conditions who do not respond to standard treatments such as steroids and antimalarial drugs.\n\nHe says about 75% of patients with affected skin will go into remission with these standard treatments.\n\n\u201cThe question has been, \u2018What do you do with the rest?\u2019\u201d he says.\n\nFranks says thalidomide can help an additional 75% of patients achieve remission. But side effects are common and some, including nerve damage in the hands and feet, can be permanent.\n\nLenalidomide Highly Effective in Small Study\n\nThe lenalidomide study included 15 women with lupus skin conditions; six had lupus in other areas of the body, too. They all were followed for seven to 30 months.\n\nAll had received standard treatments, and 14 had been treated with thalidomide previously.\n\nThe majority of the patients (60%) had the most common subtype of lupus-related skin disease, known as discoid lupus erythematosus, which is characterized by red, scaly patches that can scar.\n\nOne patient withdrew from the study after one week due to digestive system side effects. All the other patients showed improvement, and the rash cleared up in 86%.\n\nThe researchers note that the study dose was \u201cgenerally well-tolerated.\u201d No new nerve symptoms were reported.\n\nSimilar to treatment with thalidomide, most of the patients had a relapse of their skin problems within weeks of stopping the drug.\n\nNo Progression to Full Disease\n\nSeveral earlier small studies raised concerns that treatment with lenalidomide may be linked to an increased risk of progression to full-blown lupus, not just lupus limited to the skin.\n\nJosep Ordi-Ros, who led the Spanish study, says this was not seen in the latest study, which was published Dec. 6 in the journal Arthritis Research & Therapy.\n\nBut Cynthia Aranow, MD, of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y., says larger studies will be needed to determine if the drug is truly safe and effective for patients who do not respond to other treatments.\n\nShe adds that the drug appears to have a similar risk for birth defects as thalidomide, so it will need to be monitored just as carefully.\n\n\u201cThere are many questions that remain,\u201d she says.\n\nLenalidomide is available as Revlimid to treat people with multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes. According to the manufacturer\u2019s site, the cost of Revlimid at the doses used in this study would be about $440 a pill.", "images":
