guidelines are correct, and that statins show impressive benefits for men with high cholesterol levels\n\nThis article is more than 2 years old\n\nThis article is more than 2 years old\n\nStatins cut the risk of dying from heart disease by 28% among men, according to the longest study of its kind.\n\nThe 20-year project examined data from 2,560 men taking part in a randomised clinical trial to test the effects of statins versus a placebo.\n\nAll the men had very high levels of LDL, or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, (higher than 4.9mmol/L) but had no evidence of heart disease at the start of the study.\n\nNearly all men over 60 and women over 75 eligible for statins, analysis suggests Read more\n\nResearchers from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow found impressive results among those on statins, who were given the widely-prescribed type pravastatin.\n\nThey found that compared with the placebo, there was a 27% reduced risk of coronary heart disease, a 28% reduced risk of dying from coronary heart disease, and a 25% reduced risk of coronary \u201cevents\u201d such as a heart attack.\n\nThere was also an 18% reduced risk of dying from any cause over the 20-year period.\n\nSenior author Professor Kausik Ray, from Imperial\u2019s School of Public Health, said: \u201cFor the first time, we show that statins reduce the risk of death in this specific group of people who appear largely healthy except for very high LDL levels.\n\n\u201cThis legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins.\u201d\n\nRay said people with lower levels of cholesterol, around 4mmol/L, who otherwise appear healthy, should also be treated with statins.\n\nStatins prevent 80,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in UK, study finds Read more\n\nRay added: \u201cThis is the strongest evidence yet that statins reduce the risk of heart disease and death in men with high LDL.\n\n\u201cOur study lends support to LDL\u2019s status as a major driver of heart disease risk, and suggests that even modest LDL reductions might offer significant mortality benefits in the long-term.\n\n\u201cOur analysis firmly establishes that controlling LDL over time translates to fewer deaths in this population.\u201d\n\nProfessor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: \u201cThis research further demonstrates the benefits of statins for people who have high levels of cholesterol in their blood.\n\n\u201cIt shows the enduring and long-term benefit of taking statins, including the extent to which they reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, which can only be seen in a study of this length.\n\n\u201cThe role of cholesterol in causing heart disease has been disputed by some, but this paper provides yet more evidence of the link, and the benefits of statins to prevent heart disease.\u201d", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif",
