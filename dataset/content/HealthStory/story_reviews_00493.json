The treatment has traditionally been used to treat bone and blood cancers.\u201d\n\nBasil Sharrack, a consultant neurologist at Sheffield teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: \u201cThe new treatment is showing some remarkable results in the small number of patients we have treated so far.\n\n\u201cIt is important to stress, however, that this treatment is only suitable for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis disease who have had two or more significant relapses in the past 12 months, failed to respond to standard drug treatment and who have had the illness for at least 10 years.\u201d\n\nOne patient who has undergone the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), told the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme that he had made incredible progress.\n\nSteven Storey, who was diagnosed with MS in 2013, said: \u201cI went from running marathons to needing 24-hour acute care. At one point, I couldn\u2019t even hold a spoon and feed myself.\u201d\n\nWithin a few days of the transplant, he was able to move his toes, and after four months could stand unaided, although he still needs a wheelchair. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible,\u201d Storey said. \u201cI was in a dire place, but now I can swim and cycle and I am determined to walk.\u201d\n\nHolly Drewry was 21 when she was diagnosed with MS, and her condition deteriorated after she gave birth to her daughter, Isla. \u201cWithin a couple of months I got worse and worse,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t dress or wash myself; I didn\u2019t even have the strength to carry my daughter.\u201d\n\nShe had needed a wheelchair before her transplant, but after the treatment she walked out of hospital. Drewry, whose MS is described by doctors as \u201cdormant\u201d, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a miracle. I got my life and my independence back and the future is bright again in terms of being a mum and doing everything with Isla.\u201d\n\nTwo years after the treatment, she has had no relapses and there was no evidence of active disease on her scans.\n\nPaul Kirkham, another patient who has undergone the treatment at a cost of about \u00a330,000, said: \u201cIt does knock you out. I\u2019d rather have done 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.\u201d\n\nRichard Burt of Northwestern University in Chicago, who carried out the first HSCT for MS in 1995 and is coordinating the international trials, told the BBC: \u201cThere has been resistance to this in the pharma[ceutical] and academic world. This is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing.\u201d\n\nEmma Gray, the head of clinical trials at the MS Society, said: \u201cOngoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as HSCT could offer hope, and it\u2019s clear that in the cases highlighted by Panorama, they\u2019ve had a life-changing impact.\n\n\u201cHowever, trials have found that while HSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with MS, it may not be effective for all types of the condition.\n\n\u201cWe want people to be aware that HSCT is an aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks. It needs to be carried out at an accredited centre or as part of a clinical trial.\n\n\u201cThe MS Society has recently funded a study looking into the impact of HSCT on the immune system and we\u2019d like to see larger trials in this area. They would help us learn more about the safety and long term effectiveness of the treatment and who could benefit from it.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0631a7a8718ea39c087b3472a61bcb4708dd14c/0_207_5611_3368/master/5611.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e26ee7a404007634251acae9e1d02260", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Multiple+sclerosis%2CSociety%2CHealth%2CUK+news%2CCancer", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0631a7a8718ea39c087b3472a61bcb4708dd14c/0_207_5611_3368/master/5611.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=13c891a778dda57cd7ccf68e4f2494c7", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0631a7a8718ea39c087b3472a61bcb4708dd14c/0_207_5611_3368/master/5611.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=13c891a778dda57cd7ccf68e4f2494c7", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Meikle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/18/cancer-treatment-offers-ms-patients-hope-after-remarkable-trial-results", "title": "Cancer treatment offers MS patients hope after 'remarkable' trial results", "meta_data": {"description": "Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant could help treat certain form of multiple sclerosis, say doctors in Sheffield", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "James Meikle", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0631a7a8718ea39c087b3472a61bcb4708dd14c/0_207_5611_3368/master/5611.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26eec9f8484bcc42277dfc47fe78ad3e", "keywords": "Multiple sclerosis,Society,Health,UK news,Cancer", "news_keywords": "Multiple sclerosis,Society,Health,UK news,Cancer", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/18/cancer-treatment-offers-ms-patients-hope-after-remarkable-trial-results", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0631a7a8718ea39c087b3472a61bcb4708dd14c/0_207_5611_3368/master/5611.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=13c891a778dda57cd7ccf68e4f2494c7", "description": "Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant could help treat certain form of multiple sclerosis, say doctors in Sheffield", "type": "article", "title": "Cancer treatment offers MS patients hope after 'remarkable' trial results", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jamesmeikle", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Society", "published_time": "2016-01-18T18:15:26.000Z", "tag": "Multiple sclerosis,Society,Health,UK news,Cancer", "modified_time": "2017-11-29T04:01:44.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2016/jan/18/cancer-treatment-offers-ms-patients-hope-after-remarkable-trial-results?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2016/jan/18/cancer-treatment-offers-ms-patients-hope-after-remarkable-trial-results?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/18/cancer-treatment-offers-ms-patients-hope-after-remarkable-trial-results", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2016/jan/18/cancer-treatment-offers-ms-patients-hope-after-remarkable-trial-results?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0631a7a8718ea39c087b3472a61bcb4708dd14c/0_207_5611_3368/master/5611.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&s=4ceddc3167beb0fa4e87a439fd351bed", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1453093200.0, "source": "http://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
