Sanofi said this was mainly due to neutropenia, a blood disorder people can get from chemotherapy treatment, and its complications.\n\nThis compared with 1.9 percent using mitoxantrone.\n\n\u201cThe development of cabazitaxel is one of many investigational compounds we hope to present to the cancer community in the months and years to come,\u201d Debasish Roychowdhury, Sanofi\u2019s oncology senior vice president, said.\n\nThe clinical trial results will be presented at the 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) on June 6.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi-aventis-idUSTRE64Q1GY20100527", "title": "Sanofi prostate cancer drug shows 28 percent survival", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Sanofi-Aventis' cabazitaxel candidate prostate cancer drug combined with prednisone reduced the risk of death by 28 percent compared with another treatment, the outcome of a final-stage trial showed.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,SANOFI,AVENTIS", "news_keywords": "US;SANOFI;AVENTIS", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu May 27 07:09:34 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-05-27T07:09:34+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi-aventis-idUSTRE64Q1GY20100527", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Sanofi prostate cancer drug shows 28 percent survival", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,SANOFI,AVENTIS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-SANOFI-AVENTIS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Sanofi prostate cancer drug shows 28 percent survival", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2010-05-27T07:09:34+0000", "sailthru.title": "Sanofi prostate cancer drug shows 28 percent survival", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Sanofi prostate cancer drug shows 28 percent survival", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi-aventis-idUSTRE64Q1GY20100527", "type": "article", "description": "Sanofi-Aventis' cabazitaxel candidate prostate cancer drug combined with pr...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-05-27T07:09:34+0000", "modified_time": "2010-05-27T07:09:34+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,SANOFI,AVENTIS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Sanofi prostate cancer drug shows 28 percent survival", "description": "Sanofi-Aventis' cabazitaxel candidate prostate cancer drug combined with prednisone reduced the risk of death by 28 percent compared with another treatment, the outcome of a final-stage trial sho...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1274944174.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
