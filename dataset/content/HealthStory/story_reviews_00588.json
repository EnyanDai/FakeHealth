Screening did however lead to more \"overdiagnosis,\" detecting cancers that would not have been fatal or even harmful.\n\nThe research, led by Richard Wilson of Harvard University, revealed that in more than 500 US counties, mammography screening programs were linked with more diagnoses of smaller breast cancers \u2014 but not with fewer deaths or with fewer larger breast cancers (which theoretically would be prevented by finding the disease early through screening).\n\nYou can see this clearly in the chart below: The number of diagnosed breast cancers rose with more screening, yet the number of deaths from breast cancer 10 years later remained stubbornly stable.\n\nTo be clear: Mass screening is different from using technologies like ultrasounds to diagnose people at risk of a disease or who have symptoms that require investigation. And not all mass screening programs are bad. Colorectal cancer screening, for example, has been shown to save lives as a result of early detection, and the Pap test transformed cervical cancer into a treatable disease.\n\nBut this isn't the first study to call into question the benefits of mammography and whether women are too often the victims of overdiagnosis.\n\n\n\nThe trouble with overdiagnosis is that while the cancers doctors find wouldn't have harmed their patients, the treatment and stress that result from the diagnosis probably will.\n\nWe have to find a better way to screen women for breast cancer\n\nThe medical community has known about overdiagnosis and overtreatment for years, documenting the problem in a range of cancers \u2014 in breast, prostate, lung, and thyroid (which you can see in the chart above).\n\nThis raises a tough question: What should the medical community do about overdiagnosis? In a related commentary in the journal, a pair of doctors from the University of Washington School of Medicine note that the estimates of overdiagnosis of breast cancer are \"frustratingly broad\" \u2014 from less than 10 percent to 50 percent or more of women who get screened. In other words, we don't actually know how bad the problem is.\n\n\"Sadly,\" they write, \"we are left in a conundrum. Women will increasingly approach their physicians with questions and concerns about overdiagnosis, and we have no clear answers to provide.\"\n\n\n\nThe authors of the newest study don't advocate no screening. Instead, they note that the benefits of screening will probably be more favorable when screening is directed at people with a high risk of the disease \u2014 such as those with a family history of breast cancer.\n\n\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which analyzes the best available evidence to create guidelines for doctors, now recommends biennial mammography screening for the general population in women ages 50 to 74. For women under 50 and over 75 \u2014 who aren't at a high risk of breast cancer \u2014 the benefits of mass screening are less clear.\n\nThere are small things doctors can do that still don't happen often enough. For example, most women aren't told about the potential downsides of mammography screening \u2014 even though they're almost always briefed on the benefits.\n\nFor now, it's up to patients to talk to their doctors about their particular risk profiles and how to screen accordingly. We also need to remember that in medicine, more often than not, we generally overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms.\n\nWATCH: The naked mole rat might help us cure cancer", "images": ["https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3848460/thyroid_chart.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65676392/GettyImages_1308067.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D825FM0cX4l2QyMnW_sSNntOje8=/0x0:1000x750/1200x800/filters:focal(0x0:1000x750)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46680332/shutterstock_243901117.0.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65678321/1170920222.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BOf9JkUn4dMHSOWB1mFeBZCtkh8=/0x0:1024x709/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1024x709):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3588694/CCK00fIUoAAqKP1.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1sVQbnGrATV3_UzbwlbfOuvifw=/0x0:800x1026/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:800x1026):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3848382/breast%20cancer%20diagnosis.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65677516/GettyImages_1126236373.0.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3848382/breast%20cancer%20diagnosis.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65676560/BURNINGCANE_Still_1_Wendell_Pierce_Photo_by_Phillip_Youmans_Courtesy_of_ARRAY_Releasing.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65677419/1180853540.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65676467/1181126285.jpg.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3848382/breast%20cancer%20diagnosis.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Belluz", "Nicole Narea", "Sean Collins", "Peter Kafka", "Alissa Wilkinson", "Anna North", "Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8900751/breast-cancer-overdiagnosis", "title": "Here's new evidence that widespread breast cancer screening isn't effective", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/julia.belluz.7", "published_time": "2015-07-06T13:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T13:00:03-04:00"}, "author": "Julia Belluz", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/3f6cf70773b461fe6160c480506ab431/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Another study suggests that too many women may be victims of \"overdiagnosis.\"", "og": {"description": "Another study suggests that too many women may be victims of \"overdiagnosis.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3848382/breast%20cancer%20diagnosis.jpg", "alt": "Breast cancer incidence chart"}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "Here's new evidence that widespread breast cancer screening isn't effective", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8900751/breast-cancer-overdiagnosis"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2015/7/6/8900751/breast-cancer-overdiagnosis", "title": "Here's new evidence that widespread breast cancer screening isn't effective", "description": "Another study suggests that too many women may be victims of \"overdiagnosis.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3848382/breast%20cancer%20diagnosis.jpg", "alt": "Breast cancer incidence chart"}, "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "Here's new evidence that widespread breast cancer screening isn't effective", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,science-and-health", "sailthru.description": "Another study suggests that too many women may be victims of \"overdiagnosis.\"", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-06T13:00:03-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K87UTinfjP0c1UdrDRTd6GC8ljE=/0x0:1000x563/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46680332/shutterstock_243901117.0.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBEdfavjsi_gEhKOnA1l1d0wiok=/166x0:833x667/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/46680332/shutterstock_243901117.0.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "science-and-health"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1436155200.0, "source": "http://www.vox.com", "summary": ""}
