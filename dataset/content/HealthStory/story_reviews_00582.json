In actuality, about one in four adults of that age now take statins, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe guidelines, issued by two leading cardiology societies in November 2013, move away from trying to lower cholesterol to particular target levels. Instead, patients are urged to consider statins if they have an overall risk of 7.5 percent of developing a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. The risk can be calculated using an online tool that considers such factors as gender, age, race, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking status.\n\nThe guidelines were contested almost as soon as they were announced. Critics said that the online calculator greatly overstated a patient\u2019s risk of developing a heart problem and that new guidelines would lead millions of additional people to take statins, exposing them to potential side effects such as muscle pain or damage with little to gain.\n\nThat debate continues with the release of the new studies.\n\n\u201cThese two articles indicate that the new guidelines allow you to treat more people and provide better results at a reasonable cost,\u201d said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale, who was not involved in the studies.\n\nBut some say the studies have too many shortcomings to be persuasive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they are terribly informative and I don\u2019t think they change our thinking,\u201d said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, the chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/science/15statins2/15statins2-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/science/15statins2/15statins2-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/science/15statins2/15statins2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/health/broader-statin-use-gets-support-from-2-new-studies.html", "title": "2 Studies Back Guidelines for Wider Use of Statins", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-07-14T15:00:06.000Z", "modified": "2015-07-14T18:37:21.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-pollack", "tag": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003798546, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/19786f01-a245-5618-9490-1aec32b57217", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/f03e490d6ed34fc8a7e374e20091e589", "description": "The studies lend support to controversial new guidelines that could vastly increase the number of Americans advised to take cholesterol-lowering drugs.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/science/15statins2/15statins2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Andrew Pollack", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/science/15statins2/15statins2-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Statins,Cholesterol,Heart,Journal of the American Medical Assn,Pharmaceuticals", "pdate": 20150714, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/health/broader-statin-use-gets-support-from-2-new-studies.html", "type": "article", "title": "2 Studies Back Guidelines for Wider Use of Statins", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/15/science/15statins2/15statins2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "New studies could help dispel criticism of guidelines that recommend Americans take more cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins."}, "description": "The studies lend support to controversial new guidelines that could vastly increase the number of Americans advised to take cholesterol-lowering drugs."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/health/broader-statin-use-gets-support-from-2-new-studies.html", "title": "2 Studies Back Guidelines for Wider Use of Statins", "description": "The studies lend support to controversial new guidelines that could vastly increase the number of Americans advised to take cholesterol-lowering drugs.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "alt": "New studies could help dispel criticism of guidelines that recommend Americans take more cholesterol-lowering drugs, known as statins."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003798546"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/health/broader-statin-use-gets-support-from-2-new-studies.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003798546", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/health/broader-statin-use-gets-support-from-2-new-studies.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/health/broader-statin-use-gets-support-from-2-new-studies.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1436932800.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
