No one breathes in perfect rhythm all day. We hold our breath when we're concentrating. We take in more air when we exercise. Irregular breathing in the form of frequent sighing and yawning, though, brings in more air and can contribute to hyperventilation. Breath-holding, and the subsequent compensation, also can lead to hyperventilation.", "images": ["https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/fKm4SllKk6mkn6M0rH7ozwenANs=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/n25m1KE35Gh52GPV4rVFqCsZ7K0=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/Bg582Ti9YPdYkYT0QmcmkIf8GkM=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V2QZ3AVVOVB5RKAZ3VUKOMP4XQ.jpg", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/OvIG3r7WiceTaAlPOpwvbDoDM3g=/0x10/center/middle/media.philly.com/designimages/square.gif", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/QhsSiv5Pp6R9UYYdEXuIxRWg5vk=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/F-N8i3PLND7jI2semtOn2AwLUlE=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/P0EHv7XwRp9Ip-NEdUO9xOVtfow=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13"], "top_img": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/n25m1KE35Gh52GPV4rVFqCsZ7K0=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/Bg582Ti9YPdYkYT0QmcmkIf8GkM=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V2QZ3AVVOVB5RKAZ3VUKOMP4XQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stacey Burling", "Inquirer Staff Writer", "Frank Kummer", "Drew A.
