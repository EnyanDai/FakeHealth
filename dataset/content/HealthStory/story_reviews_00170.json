Users are asked to send a saliva sample -- which carries your D.N.A. -- to their lab, where it is analyzed. Results are then sent back to the user online in three to four weeks.\n\nDr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, a women's health researcher at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, told ABC News that \"one in eight [women] will get breast cancer in their lifetime.\"\n\n\"So it's very important the women who are high-risk, we want them to have access to the test, and many of us believe [the price] makes it more affordable,\" Montgomery Rice said.\n\nDevon Gant told ABC News that she used the Color test to find out that she tested positive for the BRCA 2 gene mutation.\n\nABC News\n\n\"It's kind of a black cloud,\" Gant said. \"It's this thing that's kind of looming in the future.\"\n\nGant said that although there were times when she struggled with the test results, \"it's not a death sentence.\"\n\nWhen her aunt, Lauren Rossi, took a Color test and also got a positive result for a BRCA mutation, doctors sent Rossi for an MRI, she said.\n\nABC News\n\n\"That's when they found a couple of spots, said they didn't really think it was anything,\" Rossi told ABC News. \"And it came back that it was cancer.\"\n\nRossi said that when she received the phone call she \"couldn't believe it.\"\n\nIn part due to the genetic test, and the early detection, Rossi says she is now cancer-free.\n\n\"Thank God,\" she told ABC News. \"It would've been a totally different outcome, probably next February, when I went for, you know, for my mammography.\"\n\nShe said that she is grateful that both she and Gant were tested for the BRCA gene mutation because it helped doctors detect cancer in her, and it empowers her niece with knowledge about her health.\n\n\"Now she knows,\" Rossi said of her niece. \"And she knows what she needs to do, and she'll stay healthy.\"\n\n'Window into the future'\n\nAshton describes genetic testing as showing a \"possible window into the future.\"\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t mean a guarantee because we know that genes are just one part of what determines someone\u2019s future health risks,\" she said. \"Behavior and environment are also important.\"\n\nPeople should also be aware that it is possible now to test for over 30 gene mutations associated with different types of hereditary cancer, according to Ashton. Eight of those gene mutations are associated with breast cancer.\n\n\"While all the attention goes on BRCA, it is important for people to know they can have a gene mutation in other genes and it is readily available now to test for this,\" she said. \"This is a mainstream option which I think is good news for some people.\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/braca-2-ht-er-170918_31x13_992.jpg", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/braca-1-ht-er-170918_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/devon-gant-abc-ml-170918_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/lauren-rossi-abc-ml-170918_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/braca-2-ht-er-170918_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/braca-2-ht-er-170918_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Catherine Thorbecke"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-home-brca-genetic-mutation-test/story?id=49913351", "title": "What to know about the new affordable at-home BRCA genetic mutation test", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
