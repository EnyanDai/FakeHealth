A small but growing number of hospitals offer the procedure. See photos.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Breast cancer treatment left Susan Wolfe-Tank with an arm too painfully swollen to lift anything heavy or even fit into her usual clothing \u2014 a debilitating condition that gets little attention and has no cure.\n\nDesperate, the Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to seek a delicate operation \u2014 replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery \u2014 as a small but growing number of hospitals offer microsurgical attempts at relief from lymphedema that help some patients but not all.\n\n\u201cRight in this area, feel that \u2014 that is your lymph node,\u201d Dr. David Song of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington told Wolfe-Tank during a recent check-up.\n\nSong, Georgetown\u2019s plastic surgery chief, had removed healthy lymph nodes from Wolfe-Tank\u2019s back and side and implanted them in the affected arm. As the new nodes took root, her arm was shrinking. A delighted Song\u2019s only caution: \u201cTake care of them,\u201d by wearing a compression sleeve as prescribed.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a cure. I will still have to be careful,\u201d said Wolfe-Tank, 51, of Hurley, Wisconsin. But, \u201cI will be able to cross-country ski again, just live a normal life. Look at my arm, it\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nLymphedema is a chronic swelling, often in an arm or leg, that in severe cases can be disfiguring, impair mobility, cause disabling pain, harden the skin and lead to infection.\n\nLymph nodes work like biological pumps in a network that\u2019s part of the immune system. They drain watery fluid called lymph that, traveling through tiny channels, brings nutrients to cells and takes away bacteria and waste material. Lose or damage enough lymph nodes or channels in a particular area and that fluid builds up.\n\nThere\u2019s no good count, but millions of Americans are estimated to have some degree of lymphedema, and while it can be hereditary or result from injury, many U.S. cases are a lasting side effect of treatment for a variety of cancers.\n\nConsider breast cancer. While better surgical techniques in recent decades have lowered the risk, experts estimate that still about 6 percent of breast cancer survivors who undergo a \u201csentinel node biopsy\u201d \u2014 removing a few nodes to check for spreading cancer \u2014 will develop lymphedema. That risk jumps to about 20 percent for women like Wolfe-Tank who need additional lymph nodes removed because of more advanced cancer. Radiation causes further harm.\n\nYet too often women aren\u2019t warned about symptoms or checked for early signs, when lymphedema is more easily treated, said Dr. Sheldon Feldman of New York\u2019s Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care. He co-authored physician guidelines issued this fall by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.\n\nTypical patients have \u201chad that swelling for a while,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cNow the treatment is an uphill battle.\u201d\n\nThe main treatment consists of wearing compression bandages and massage to bring down swelling. A lymphedema specialist initially prescribed a large pump that massaged Wolfe-Tank\u2019s arm for an hour a night, temporarily relieving some of the pain.\n\n\u201cBut if I used my arm, I was back to square one,\u201d Wolfe-Tank said. \u201cI didn\u2019t fit into my coat anymore. I live in the snow capital of Wisconsin. I\u2019m not supposed to shovel. We\u2019ve got to fix this.\u201d\n\nWolfe-Tank had struggled for four years when an oncologist recommended lymph node transfer. The rationale: There are more lymph nodes in the body\u2019s trunk than in the limbs \u2014 more avenues to drain off fluid \u2014 and thus it should be safe to move a few. Hunting for a surgeon, Wolfe-Tank found Song, who transferred about five nodes along with supportive blood vessels and other tissue, hoping they\u2019d grow new channels to drain fluid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the only option. A technique called lymphovenous bypass reroutes lymph-carrying channels, going around damaged or missing nodes to drain into veins instead.\n\nSome surgeons use a variation of that technique protectively, in hopes of preventing lymphedema from forming in the first place. During the initial cancer surgery, they check which lymph-carrying channels the node removal left dangling \u2014 and connect them to blood vessels to drain.\n\n\u201cSurgical options offer great potential,\u201d note the breast surgeons\u2019 new guidelines. But they don\u2019t work for everyone.\n\nAbout a third of lymph node transfer patients see some positive effect, Song said.\n\nAnd Feldman noted that over about the past decade, the microsurgeries have been studied only in small research trials, and results vary with surgeon experience. One debate is whether to offer lymph node transfer early, before patients build up as much damage as Wolfe-Tank did. Insurance coverage also varies.\n\nFeldman\u2019s bottom line: Patients considering microsurgery should be evaluated in a comprehensive lymphedema program to determine their best options.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 The Associated Press.
