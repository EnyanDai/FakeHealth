Many studies have documented the lower risk of various cancers among people who eat more fresh produce, and avoid things like red and processed meat.\n\nBut the majority of those studies have focused on adults, and it\u2019s becoming clear that many of cancer\u2019s drivers start early in life, with genes and even with childhood exposures to potential carcinogens.\n\nTo investigate this further, Maryam Farvid, a research associate at Massachusetts General Hospital and a visiting scientist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk. In a study reported in the BMJ, they plumbed the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes, including cancer.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.\n\nMORE: With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies\n\nCertain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer \u2014 apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.\n\nFarvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth. Kale and oranges are high in vitamin C, another antioxidant.\n\nMORE: Mediterranean Diet With Olive Oil Linked to Lower Breast Cancer Risk\n\n\u201cThis study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,\u201d says Farvid. \u201cThis study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program.\u201d\n\nFarvid wasn\u2019t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk, but says that may be because the study wasn\u2019t powered enough to detect an effect.\n\nThe findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later, and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age, especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life.\n\nThe results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit\u2019s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. \u201cWe recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,\u201d says Farvid, \u201cbecause maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.

The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.\n\nTaken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer. While challenging, changing diet can be a relatively easy way to alter a woman\u2019s breast cancer risk equation, beginning even at a young age.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/breast-cancer-angelina-jolie.jpg?quality=85&w=342", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/lung-cancer-rates-women-men.jpg?quality=85&w=321"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alice Park"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4326798/breast-cancer-diet-teen-girls-fruit/", "title": "What Teen Girls Should Eat to Reduce Breast Cancer Risk", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "breast cancer, preventing breast cancer, diet, anti cancer diet, foods that prevent breast cancer, breast cancer and teens, how to prevent breast cancer,", "news_keywords": "breast cancer, preventing breast cancer, diet, anti cancer diet, foods that prevent breast cancer, breast cancer and teens, how to prevent breast cancer,", "description": "Changing one's diet, even from a young age, can significantly help prevent breast cancer, according to new research.", "og": {"title": "What Teen Girls Should Eat to Reduce Breast Cancer Risk", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4326798/breast-cancer-diet-teen-girls-fruit/", "description": "Changing one's diet, even from a young age, can make a big difference", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4326798/breast-cancer-diet-teen-girls-fruit/", "description": "Changing one's diet, even from a young age, can significantly help prevent breast cancer, according to new research.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4326798/breast-cancer-diet-teen-girls-fruit/", "title": "What Teen Girls Should Eat to Reduce Breast Cancer Risk", "description": "Changing one's diet, even from a young age, can make a big difference", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-tangerines.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
