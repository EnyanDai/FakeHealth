It also adds new information.\n\n\"The protection started at more than 45 grams [about 1.5 ounces] a week,\" says researcher Susanna C. Larsson, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe group eating the most chocolate got the most benefit, reducing stroke intake by 20%. In this group, the median intake (half ate more, half less) was about 2.3 ounces a week.\n\nThe research is published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nWhile other studies have found a link between eating chocolate and reduced stroke risk, this research found a slight difference in protection, depending on type of stroke. Those who ate the most chocolate were protected a bit more from strokes caused by hemorrhage than strokes caused by obstruction such as blood clots. Larsson isn't sure why.", "images":
