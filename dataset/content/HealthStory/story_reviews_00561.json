With complicated grief, \u201csomething gets in the way of that adaptation,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething impedes the course of healing.\u201d\n\nHow common is this prolonged grief? An epidemiological study of more than 2,500 people, conducted in Germany in 2009, put the proportion at nearly 7 percent, and at 9 percent among those over age 61.\n\nGeorge A. Bonanno, director of the Loss, Trauma and Emotion Lab at Columbia University Teachers College, said the real figure might be closer to 10 to 15 percent.\n\nDr. Bonanno, author of \u201cThe Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After Loss,\u201d argues that resilience is the typical response to the death of loved ones. Yet, he notes, \u201cwe always see a group of people who don\u2019t recover.\u201d\n\nThe problem appears more likely when a death is sudden or violent; when the person who died was one\u2019s spouse, romantic partner or child; and when the bereaved person has a history of depression, anxiety or substance abuse.\n\nDefining this sort of grief has engendered some professional disagreement. What criteria distinguish complicated grief from depression or anxiety? When does normal grief become prolonged? Researchers disagree on even the condition\u2019s name.\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association, in the latest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, declined to classify complicated grief as a mental disorder and instead included \u201cpersistent complex bereavement-related disorder\u201d in an appendix for further study.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/science/18SPAN/18SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/science/18SPAN/18SPAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/science/18SPAN/18SPAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paula Span"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/health/complicated-grief-so-deep-it-wont-die.html", "title": "A Grief So Deep It Won\u2019t Die", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-08-14T10:00:24.000Z", "modified": "2015-08-14T10:00:23.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/paula-span", "tag": "Therapy and Rehabilitation", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003850074, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/a4c06ac4-f54e-5a84-a68c-f23965512863", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/8d8e386ce5df441b94c0d6ef6f6e87b3", "description": "Following the death of a loved one, some people experience a mourning period that may last for years, signaling the need for aggressive therapy.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/science/18SPAN/18SPAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Paula Span", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/science/18SPAN/18SPAN-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "news_keywords": "Grief,,Therapy", "pdate": 20150814, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/health/complicated-grief-so-deep-it-wont-die.html", "type": "article", "title": "A Grief So Deep It Won\u2019t Die", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/science/18SPAN/18SPAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "After losing her husband, Anne Schomaker found that \"the pain just didn't go away.\" She had been grieving for nine years when she decided to participate in a study of complicated grief therapy at Columbia University."}, "description": "Following the death of a loved one, some people experience a mourning period that may last for years, signaling the need for aggressive therapy."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/health/complicated-grief-so-deep-it-wont-die.html", "title": "A Grief So Deep It Won\u2019t Die", "description": "Following the death of a loved one, some people experience a mourning period that may last for years, signaling the need for aggressive therapy.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/18/science/18SPAN/18SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg", "alt": "After losing her husband, Anne Schomaker found that \"the pain just didn't go away.\" She had been grieving for nine years when she decided to participate in a study of complicated grief therapy at Columbia University."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003850074"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "CN": "the-new-old-age", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/health/complicated-grief-so-deep-it-wont-die.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003850074", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/health/complicated-grief-so-deep-it-wont-die.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/health/complicated-grief-so-deep-it-wont-die.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1439870400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
