It's always signaling to the nucleus [of the tumor cells] that it's time to divide,\" Chapman explained.\n\nThat finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments.\n\nPLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said.\n\nIn the trial, 55 patients received escalating doses of the drug. Ten of 16 patients who had the BRAF gene mutation had a partial response to the drug, meaning the tumor shrank by at least 30 percent, while one had a complete response, with the tumor disappearing altogether.\n\nAmong 32 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma in the second phase of the study, 24 had a partial response and two had a complete response.\n\n\"It worked: 81 percent had a partial response -- which has never been seen. I don't know of any solid tumors that have a response rate that high,\" said Chapman. \"What's different here is that we've discovered a molecule that is responsible for driving the melanoma cell. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF. It matters. It's addicted to this pathway.\"\n\nThere are some important caveats, however. It's not known at this time if the drug can improve overall survival, and a sizable proportion of participants developed resistance to the drug, the researchers say.\n\nThe findings join other recent reports of potential treatments for melanoma in what appears to be an exciting time for the field. Progress in this field has essentially been stalled for decades, experts say.\n\nRecently, scientists reported that another experimental drug, ipilimumab, prolonged median survival in patients with metastatic melanoma from 6.4 months to 10 months.\n\n\"[Existing therapy] is not good for melanoma, so this is really a new opportunity that I think may have some importance to people,\" Pentland said.\n\nHowever, she stressed that the best defense against melanoma is to get your skin examined regularly by a professional who knows what to look for.\n\n\"Our most successful treatment is to get [the lesion] early, get it before it's thick, get it before it spreads,\" she said.\n\nMore information\n\nThere's more on metastatic melanoma at the U.S. National Cancer Institute.", "images": ["http://consumer.Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "http://consumer.Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Gardner"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/skin-cancer-news-108/in-early-trial-targeted-therapy-fights-advanced-melanoma-642479.html", "title": "In Early Trial, Targeted Therapy Fights Advanced Melanoma", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "Experimental drug could help patients whose tumors carry particular gene mutation", "og": {"title": "In Early Trial, Targeted Therapy Fights Advanced Melanoma", "description": "Experimental drug could help patients whose tumors carry particular gene mutation", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/skin-cancer-news-108/in-early-trial-targeted-therapy-fights-advanced-melanoma-642479.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://consumer.Healthday.com", "summary": ""}
