The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study.\n\nKing worked on the original clinical trial on which the new analysis is based. The study, known as Active, examined the effects of cognitive training programs on 2,785 healthy older adults.\n\nParticipants were divided into three groups. One got training for memory improvement, one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed-of-processing.\n\nIn the speed training, which emphasized visual perception, individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly. The program got harder with each correct answer.\n\nParticipants had 10 one-hour training sessions conducted in a classroom setting over five weeks. Some received four additional \u201cbooster\u201d sessions one year after the original training, and four more two years after that.\n\nScientists measured cognitive and functional changes immediately and at one, two, three, five and 10 years after the training to see if it affected how participants performed daily tasks.\n\nResults of that study, published in 2014, found modest benefits in the reasoning and speed-of-processing groups, but not memory.\n\nThe new analysis was by Dr. Jerri Edwards of the University of South Florida, whose mentor, Dr. Karlene Ball of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, sold her rights to the program to Posit Science. Edwards also was a paid consultant for the company for part of 2008.\n\nThe program is now incorporated in Posit Science\u2019s BrainHQ.com brain training program.\n\nEdwards did a secondary analysis of the 10-year data, looking at the time it took individuals to develop dementia.\n\nShe found that the group that did speed training showed 33 percent less risk of dementia relative to the control group, while the memory and the reasoning interventions offered no such benefit.\n\nPeople who completed 11 or more speed training sessions were at 48 percent less risk for developing dementia over the 10 years of the study, Edwards said.\n\n\u201cAt first blush, that\u2019s kind of a big deal,\u201d Mayo Clinic Alzheimer\u2019s expert Dr. Ronald Petersen said. \u201cThis may even be clinically relevant.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, a group of nearly 70 neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists led by researchers at Stanford University\u2019s Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development signed a letter saying there was \u201clittle evidence\u201d of such results from brain games. The letter was in response to heavy marketing by companies touting the benefits of their programs based on scant scientific data.\n\nEdwards said she was frustrated with the scientific debate, which is one reason she agreed to present her findings before they were published. \u201cI\u2019m sick of our studies being ignored,\u201d she said.\n\nKing said the training offered in the program was slightly different from the current Posit Science offering and that it was unclear whether speed training would help people who are already at risk for dementia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a promising result from an interesting data set,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think we will know more after the paper is reviewed.\u201d", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brain-training-dementia-idUSKCN1040TX", "title": "'Brain training' cut dementia risk in healthy adults -U.S. study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "A computerized brain training program cut the risk of dementia among healthy people by 48 percent, U.S. researchers said on Sunday in reporting an analysis of the results of a 10-year study.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "United States,Jerri Edwards,John King,Karlene Ball,Mayo Clinic Alzheimer,Ronald Petersen,US,BRAIN,TRAINING,DEMENTIA,General News,Health / Medicine,Dementia,Science,Healthcare (TRBC),Corporate Events,Canada,United States", "news_keywords": "United States;Jerri Edwards;John King;Karlene Ball;Mayo Clinic Alzheimer;Ronald Petersen;US;BRAIN;TRAINING;DEMENTIA;General News;Health / Medicine;Dementia;Science;Healthcare (TRBC);Corporate Events;Canada;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Jul 24 17:19:51 UTC 2016", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2016-07-24T17:19:51+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brain-training-dementia-idUSKCN1040TX", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "'Brain training' cut dementia risk in healthy adults -U.S. study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Jerri Edwards,John King,Karlene Ball,Mayo Clinic Alzheimer,Ronald Petersen,US,BRAIN,TRAINING,DEMENTIA,General News,Health / Medicine,Dementia,Science,Healthcare (TRBC),Corporate Events,Canada,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-BRAIN-TRAINING-DEMENTIA", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "'Brain training' cut dementia risk in healthy adults -U.S. study", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2016-07-24T17:19:51+0000", "sailthru.title": "'Brain training' cut dementia risk in healthy adults -U.S. study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "'Brain training' cut dementia risk in healthy adults -U.S. study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brain-training-dementia-idUSKCN1040TX", "type": "article", "description": "A computerized brain training program cut the risk of dementia among healthy peo...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-07-24T17:19:51+0000", "modified_time": "2016-07-24T17:19:51+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "United States,Jerri Edwards,John King,Karlene Ball,Mayo Clinic Alzheimer,Ronald Petersen,US,BRAIN,TRAINING,DEMENTIA,General News,Health / Medicine,Dementia,Science,Healthcare (TRBC),Corporate Events,Canada,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "'Brain training' cut dementia risk in healthy adults -U.S. study", "description": "A computerized brain training program cut the risk of dementia among healthy people by 48 percent, U.S. researchers said on Sunday in reporting an analysis of the results of a 10-year study.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
