In Japan, \u201cfood and health care companies have found cosmetic applications for their ingredients, so they are creating skin care brands.\u201d\n\nFor example, Frutarom, a flavor-ingredient house based in Israel, makes Alguard, a purified polysaccharide shield from a red microalgae that it says protects skin from daily assaults and reduces roughness as well as the look of fine lines.\n\nThere are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said. The patent-pending alguronic acid in Algenist is a \u201csingle, purified, highly bioactive compound,\u201d said Tony Day, the vice president for research and development at Solazyme, and therefore delivers \u201cmuch higher activity to the skin\u201d than products using only a microalgae extract.\n\nStudies conducted by an independent lab and commissioned by Algenist, none of which have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed alguronic acid increased cell regeneration and the synthesis of elastin (which gives skin that snap-back youthful quality). This testing also demonstrated that alguronic acid provided protection against cell damage induced by ultraviolet rays, and inhibited the enzymes that break down elastin.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter reviewing press materials and Solazyme\u2019s 84-page patent application, Dr. David McDaniel, a dermatologist and the director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va., said he was impressed by the in-vitro testing of alguronic acid. \u201cIn the petri dish, their data seems to show some substantial benefits to their active ingredient,\u201d he said. But he cautioned that in-vitro testing does not demonstrate how a final formulation works off the shelf.\n\nDr. Dana Sachs, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, wrote in an e-mail after looking at Algenist\u2019s dossier that \u201cthe claims on cell regeneration and elastin synthesis are based on in vitro models, which is hard to extrapolate to in vivo, and again no statistical significance is presented, so this is a weak claim.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Day, who has a doctorate in biochemistry, said that statistical significance was found but not included in press materials. And, according to the company, a study of 30 women showed that after 10 days of using the Algenist serum, they had a 25 percent decrease in wrinkles as shown by silicone replicas of their faces.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Dr. McDaniel, who does research into using plant-derived products to lengthen the life of cells, says he thinks the comparative data must be viewed with caution because the studies that yielded it are \u201cchallenging to do accurately, hard to interpret and not necessarily predictive of final products.\u201d\n\nSoon, consumers will judge whether Algenist products are a breakthrough. In an unusual move, Sephora is introducing the line in 800 locations in 8 countries all at once, in a rollout coordinated with QVC. \u201cIt was a brand nobody has ever heard of,\u201d said Allen Burke, the senior adviser for beauty strategy and development at QVC. \u201cWe want to give it a lot of visibility all at the same time.\u201d But Mr. Burke knows that marketing has its limits. \u201cIt can be the most interesting story in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it doesn\u2019t deliver, it\u2019s not a business that we can do.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN-2/Z-SKIN-C-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN-span/Z-SKIN-A-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SPOTS-1/Z-SPOTS-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN-1/Z-SKIN-B-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN-span/Z-SKIN-A-thumbStandard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN-span/Z-SKIN-A-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catherine Saint Louis", "Skin Deep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN.html", "title": "Algenist\u2019s Algae-Based Skin Products Rise From the Sea", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069685042", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069685042"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN.html", "title": "Algenist\u2019s Algae-Based Skin Products Rise From the Sea", "description": "Scientists studying algae find themselves with a skin-care line.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "cslwrites"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Trolling the Oceans To Combat Aging", "description": "Scientists studying algae find themselves with a skin-care line.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1248069685042, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Algenist\u2019s Algae-Based Skin Products Rise From the Sea", "col": "Skin Deep", "pdate": 20110323, "utime": 20141015215648, "ptime": 20110323134844, "DISPLAYDATE": "March 23, 2011", "dat": "March 23, 2011", "lp": "Scientists studying algae find themselves with a skin-care line.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "24SKIN", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "published": "2011-03-23T13:48:44-04:00", "modified": "2014-10-15T21:56:48-04:00", "section": "Fashion & Style", "section-taxonomy-id": "B3DFBD82-F298-43B3-9458-219B4F6AA2A5", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/fashion/index.html", "top-level-section": "fashion", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/catherine-saint-louis", "tag": "Algae"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/fashion/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN.html", "type": "article", "title": "Algenist\u2019s Algae-Based Skin Products Rise From the Sea", "description": "Scientists studying algae find themselves with a skin-care line.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN-span/Z-SKIN-A-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Catherine Saint Louis", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS", "PT": "article", "CG": "fashion", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Algae", "keywords": "Skin,Cosmetics and Toiletries,Algae", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/03/24/fashion/24SKIN-span/Z-SKIN-A-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "nyt-collection": {"display-name": "Skin Deep", "identifier": "skin-deep", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/column/skin-deep", "uri": "/column/skin-deep", "tone": "feature", "tagline": "Tips and trends for hair, makeup and more.", "type": "column"}, "CN": "skin-deep", "CT": "column", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "fashion", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1300939200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
