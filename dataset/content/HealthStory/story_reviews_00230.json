All received top-notch asthma treatment, and were randomly assigned to take either Gleevec or a placebo pill once daily during the 6-month trial.\n\nBlood tests showed that Gleevec did reduce mast cell activity in patients, Israel said.\n\nFurther, allergy challenge tests showed a decrease in airway reactivity among patients taking Gleevec, the researchers reported. Airways became less likely to close off after exposure to an allergen.\n\nPhysical examinations showed that people taking Gleevec actually experienced a slight overall widening of their airways, Israel added.\n\n\"There was a small but significant improvement in the airway narrowing in these patients, which we didn't expect because we didn't think the mast cells were necessarily promoting that airway narrowing all the time,\" Israel said.\n\nSide-effects were not as severe as expected, he added. One person dropped out because of a sharp decline in white blood cells, which bounced back after the drug was discontinued. Another person dropped out because of leg cramps associated with the drug.\n\n\"All in all, we were expecting a significantly greater pattern of side-effects, and we didn't see it,\" Israel explained.\n\nAccording to Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"This drug represents a new mechanism for the immune modulation of severe asthma.\" Horovitz was not involved with the study.\n\n\"It has been a while since a new approach and treatment for severe asthma has emerged,\" Horovitz said. \"Further studies will be needed to assess its utility in moderate asthma.\"\n\nPulmonologist Dr. Theodore Maniatis is medical director of Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He sounded a more cautionary note.\n\n\"This is a very early work that in no way should encourage asthmatics,\" Maniatis said. \"While it is a very interesting study for pulmonologists and immunologists, it is a very small study.\"\n\nUntil now, \"this immune-modulating drug has been used only for cancer and is toxic,\" he added. \"It will take years of study to determine the usefulness of this drug in treatment.\"\n\nIsrael agreed that further clinical trials are needed. \"Before you go out and recommend this be used in general, you really want to repeat this in a larger population with greater numbers,\" he said.\n\nIt likely will be three to four years before Gleevec could be approved for asthma treatment, Israel estimated.\n\nIf proven effective, Gleevec might provide a relatively inexpensive new treatment for asthma patients. Two generic versions of the drug were launched last year, which could make it less pricey than new-wave asthma drugs headed for the market, Israel added.\n\nThe study was published May 18 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on asthma, visit the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.", "images": ["https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/18254.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/18254.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dennis Thompson"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/gleevec-news-834/could-cancer-drug-gleevec-help-with-severe-asthma-722902.html", "title": "Could Cancer Drug Gleevec Help With Severe Asthma?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "Small study suggests a new approach might  one day help those with uncontrolled lung disease", "og": {"title": "Could Cancer Drug Gleevec Help With Severe Asthma?", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/18254.jpg", "description": "Small study suggests a new approach might  one day help those with uncontrolled lung disease", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/gleevec-news-834/could-cancer-drug-gleevec-help-with-severe-asthma-722902.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://consumer.healthday.com", "summary": ""}
