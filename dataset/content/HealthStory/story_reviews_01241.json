The first version arrived in 2007, developed by the namesake company in Fremont, Calif. A second-generation commercial version came out in October 2009.\n\nA recent morning found Moore gearing up for his twice-weekly, 25-minute workout on the machine during his regular therapy session at The Suites at Holly Creek, a retirement community and assisted-living facility in Centennial where he spent several weeks before returning to his practice.\n\nHe was assisted by Jennifer Lo, Holly Creek\u2019s director of rehabilitation.\n\nAt $25,000, the AlterG is expensive, but the technology is simple. Compressed air is pumped into a plastic chamber over the treadmill, creating \u201clift.\u201d The patient is sealed from the waist down inside the chamber, and a computer panel allows patients to take up to 80 percent of their body weight off their joints.\n\nSo a 200-pound man can wind up effectively feeling like he weighs only 40 pounds \u2014 a real boon when you\u2019re trying to rehab shattered shins, as Moore is.\n\nGearing up\n\nAt first glance, Moore looked like he was gearing up for a deep-sea dive.\n\nStep 1 was getting into a pair of neoprene shorts topped with a stiff reinforced fabric that encircled his waist. This ring contained a zipper that, when Moore stepped onto the treadmill, was attached to another zipper, forming a seal.\n\nAir was pumped in, and Lo programmed the AlterG to let Moore walk at 68 percent of his 205-pound body weight. His legs were effectively supporting a 139-pound man. Moore, who still limps badly 9 1/2 months after the accident, started walking with alacrity \u2014 no trace of hobbling at all.\n\n\u201cThe thing about this machine is that when patients get in here and offload their weight by 30 or 40 percent, they can resume their normal gait,\u201d Lo said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not just working their legs, they\u2019re getting a cardio workout too.\u201d\n\nAs Moore walked on the treadmill, he marveled at what it allows him to do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m walking as fast as I did before the accident,\u201d said Moore, 66. \u201cI\u2019m walking as normal as I did a year ago.\u201d\n\nWhen his session ended, the machine\u2019s whirring stopped and the plastic bubble encasing his lower body deflated. Moore stepped onto the carpeted floor and took a few halting steps toward the leg brace he wears.\n\n\u201cNow here I am back in real life,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are only a few of the 750-pound units in the area.\n\nThe Suites at Clermont Park uses them. Ditto for Mountain View Physical Therapy in Evergreen, Azura Senior Living in Boulder and the Life Care Center of Littleton. Mountain View\u2019s AlterG is available to the general public, and athletes sometimes rent time on it to do speed work and interval training.\n\nKnee, back rehab\n\n\u201cWe use it a lot for patients doing post-surgical rehab for their knees and backs,\u201d says Valerie Gluth, a physical therapist and Mountain View\u2019s owner. \u201cIt lets people walk with a normal gait so they don\u2019t develop bad habits that lead to other orthopedic problems. A limp is easy to develop and hard to get rid of.\u201d\n\nElite distant runners such as Dathan Ritzenhein and Shannon Rowbury have used the AlterG, and professional sports teams such as the Los Angeles Lakers and England\u2019s Manchester United soccer club have used the machines. They\u2019re also used at Walter Reed Army Medical Center to treat injured soldiers and at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.\n\n\u201cThe AlterG treadmill is an excellent rehabilitation device,\u201d Rowbury said. \u201cIt was a huge asset to me when I was recovering from a stress fracture in my hip because it allowed me to reintroduce running in a safe, low-impact environment. I could gradually build up my strength so that when my bone was healed enough to tolerate full-body- weight running, my muscles were strong enough to support me.\u201d\n\nThe machines are also used to help obese patients \u2014 not just for training, but in giving them incentive by showing them how their feet and knees would feel better if they lost, say, 100 pounds.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to be everywhere with rehab units, and with recreational and elite athletes too,\u201d said Lo, who is a trail runner and competitive ultra- marathoner in her off hours.\n\nWilliam Porter: 303-954-1877 or wporter@denverpost.com", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a32740e93670834ab1dd044a62b785b7?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20110115__20110117_C01_FE17FTALTERGp1.jpg?w=600&h=471", "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20110115__20110117_C01_FE17FTALTERGp1.jpg?w=600&h=471", "keywords": [], "authors": ["William Porter", "Restaurant Critic William Porter Is A Feature Writer At The Denver Post", "Where He Covers Food", "Culture", "People.
