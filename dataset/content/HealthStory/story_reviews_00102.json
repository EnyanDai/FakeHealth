IVs are one of the most common things in health care.\n\nNew research calls into question what\u2019s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Using a different intravenous fluid instead of the usual saline greatly reduced the risk of death or kidney damage, two large studies found.\n\nThe difference could mean 50,000 to 70,000 fewer deaths and 100,000 fewer cases of kidney failure each year in the U.S., researchers estimate. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been sounding the alarm for 20 years\u201d about possible harms from saline, said Dr. John Kellum, a critical care specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt\u2019s purely inertia\u201d that prevents a change, he said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nKellum had no role in the two studies, which were discussed Tuesday at a critical care conference in San Antonio and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Federal grants helped pay for the work.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address.

They are used to prevent dehydration, maintain blood pressure, or give patients medicines or nutrients if they can\u2019t eat.\n\nSaline \u2014 salt dissolved in water \u2014 has been the most widely used fluid in the U.S. for more than a century even as evidence has emerged that it can harm kidneys, especially when used a lot.\n\nOther IV solutions called balanced fluids include saline but also contain potassium and other things that make them more like plasma, the clear part of blood. They\u2019re widely used in Europe and Australia.\n\nThe studies involved 28,000 patients at Vanderbilt University who were given IVs of saline or a balanced fluid. For every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem.\n\nSince there are about 30 million people hospitalized in the U.S. alone each year, \u201cthere are tens or hundreds of thousands of patients who would be spared death or severe kidney problems by using balanced fluids instead of saline,\u201d said one study leader, Vanderbilt\u2019s Dr. Matthew Semler.\n\nAfter seeing the results two months ago, Vanderbilt hospital officials decided to primarily use balanced fluids. The University of Pittsburgh also has largely switched to them, Kellum said.\n\nThe fluids cost about the same \u2014 a dollar or two per IV \u2014 and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.\n\nIV fluids have been in the news since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last fall, shutting down electricity to three plants owned by Baxter International (BAX), one of the biggest makers of these fluids. The shortage has eased, but some supply issues remain.\n\n\u2014 Marilynn Marchionne", "images": ["https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsletter-Logo-Images-DR.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/stat-logo.svg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/plugins/stat-lazy-load/images/330x400-00000000.png", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=46858&fmt=gif", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Infusion_AP_328963423903-645x645.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Infusion_AP_328963423903-1024x576.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=436331036555416&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Infusion_AP_328963423903-1024x576.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Associated Press", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Sharon Begley", "Megan Thielking", "Elizabeth Preston"], "canonical_link": "https://www.statnews.com/2018/02/27/iv-bag-saline-patients-hospitals/", "title": "What\u2019s in the IV bag?
