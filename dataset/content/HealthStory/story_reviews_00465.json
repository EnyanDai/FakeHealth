Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can\u2019t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.\n\nMORE: NFL\u2019s Concussion Research Full of Holes, Report Finds\n\nBut in a study published in JAMA Neurology, scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.\n\nThey collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people\u2019s symptoms.\n\nMORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease\n\nIn all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they\u2019re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.\n\nGet The Brief.

It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.\n\nMORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field\n\nIn the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan \u2014 the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don\u2019t need one.\n\nAnd because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don\u2019t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they\u2019re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they\u2019re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.\n\n\u201cWe may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,\u201d she says.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-482186651-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/couple-experimental-treatment-battle-alzheimer-disease-hospital.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-482186651-1.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/gettyimages-548554295.jpeg?quality=85&w=600"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-482186651-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alice Park"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4272765/blood-test-for-concussions/", "title": "Concussion Blood Test Shows Promise", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "blood test,Brain,brain injury,Concussion,traumatic brain injury", "news_keywords": "concussion, blood test, blood test for concussion, brain injury, traumatic brain injury, concussion symptoms", "description": "With greater awareness about the dangers of head blows, researchers say a blood test may diagnose more serious traumatic brain injuries", "og": {"title": "Blood Test For Concussion Shows Promise", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4272765/blood-test-for-concussions/", "description": "With greater awareness about the dangers of head blows, researchers say a blood test may diagnose more serious traumatic brain injuries", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-482186651-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4272765/blood-test-for-concussions/", "description": "With greater awareness about the dangers of head blows, researchers say a blood test may diagnose more serious traumatic brain injuries", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-482186651-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4272765/blood-test-for-concussions/", "title": "Blood Test For Concussion Shows Promise", "description": "With greater awareness about the dangers of head blows, researchers say a blood test may diagnose more serious traumatic brain injuries", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/gettyimages-482186651-1.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
