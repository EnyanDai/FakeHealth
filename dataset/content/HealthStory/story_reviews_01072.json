They can see that their unexpected and unpredictable oscillations of blood sugar are minimized. They also lost weight,\" Dandona tells WebMD. \"Over a protracted period of time, as their diabetes continues to be well controlled, there is delightful improvement in patients' well-being.\"\n\nAt the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston, Dandona reported the results of a study in which 14 adults, whose type 1 diabetes was well controlled with insulin given via an insulin pump, received once-daily Victoza for either one week or 24 weeks.\n\nContinuous glucose monitoring showed that their blood sugar was as tightly controlled as possible with insulin treatment. Yet all patients' blood sugar peaked and dipped at unpredictable intervals.\n\nAdding Victoza to insulin therapy quickly eliminated these peaks and dips in blood sugar. After one week, average fasting and weekly blood sugar levels each dropped by about 15%.\n\nAnd during Victoza treatment, patients needed less and less insulin. Their average dose of mealtime insulin decreased by seven units (30%) and their need for all-day insulin dropped by eight units (32%).\n\nPatients who continued treatment for 24 weeks had further decreases in insulin doses, and lost an average of 10 pounds. This appeared to be due to reduced appetite and food intake. Hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from 6.5% to a normal level of 6.1%.\n\n\"Some patients have now been treated for up to a year, and the effect is as good as it was at the beginning,\" Dandona said at a news conference webcast from Boston.", "images":
