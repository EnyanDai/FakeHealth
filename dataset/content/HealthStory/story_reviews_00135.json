On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.\n\nFor measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels. They also wore a sensor that tracked their movements at night, including indications of restlessness.\n\nClosed environments tended to have less background noise \u2013 but they also had significantly higher carbon dioxide levels, which indicated lower ventilation levels.\n\nOpen conditions were slightly cooler than closed, although humidity levels were similar across settings, according to the report in the journal Indoor Air.\n\nNotably, carbon dioxide levels were lower when windows or doors were open.\n\nOverall, skin temperature and the bed temperature were higher in closed conditions than open conditions. The number of awakenings and sleep efficiency improved as carbon dioxide levels decreased.\n\n\u201cOpening an internal door can be a reasonably good alternative if you don\u2019t want to open windows, either for noise concerns or security concerns,\u201d Mishra said.\n\nA limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night.\n\n\u201cSleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,\u201d said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn\u2019t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns. He is also part of LIFE Index-Air, a European research group that focuses on human exposure to pollutants.\n\nIn a recent study, Canha and colleagues found that closed doors and windows led to higher levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other substances such as formaldehyde.\n\n\u201cSleep is essential to our life in several areas: health, well-being and productivity,\u201d Canha told Reuters Health by email. \u201cThe exposure we are under while asleep is continuous . . . and we should play it safe in order to breathe better air during sleep.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2BOsgOd Indoor Air, online November 21, 2017.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carolyn Crist", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sleep-idUSKBN1E12DK", "title": "Open windows and doors can improve sleep quality", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
