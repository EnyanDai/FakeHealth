This benefit is thought to come from the omega-3 fatty acids in fish, although studies of fish oil supplements have produced disappointing results in people who already have Alzheimer's.\n\n\"The new study is the first to establish a direct relationship between fish consumption, brain structure, and Alzheimer's risk,\" Raji says.\n\n\"More fish, more brain, less Alzheimer's,\" he tells WebMD.\n\nRaji presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.", "images":
