Pooling data from 522 trials including nearly 120,000 patients, researchers found all drugs analysed were more effective than placebos in the treatment of adults with acute depression.\n\nAuthors of the study\u2014published yesterday in the Lancet\u2014believe many more people could benefit from antidepressant medication.\n\nThe study results represent the most comprehensive evidence currently available, they wrote.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nStephen Chernin/Getty Images\n\nMore than 300 million people worldwide have depression, according to the World Health Organization, of which less than half recieve effective treatments. In many countries, the rate drops to less than 10 percent.\n\nIn the U.S., the National Institute of Mental Health estimates 16.2 million adults experienced at least one major depressive episode in 2016. Approximately 37 percent of these people received no treatment.\n\nIn the U.K, where a number of the study authors are based, at least one million more people could benefit from drugs or psychotherapy, senior author John Geddes said.\n\nSome drugs more effective than others\n\nThe researchers analyzed existing studies of 21 different drugs, and found some were much more effective than others.\n\nDrugs ranged from more than one third more effective than a placebo to more than twice as effective. The best performers included amitriptyline and escitalopram, while the worst included fluoxetine\u2014commonly sold under the trade name Prozac\u2014and reboxetine, which is not approved for sale in the U.S.\n\nA complex treatment picture\n\nThe results add up to a complex treatment picture for what authors called \u201cone of the most common, burdensome, and costly psychiatric disorders worldwide in adults.\u201d\n\nAntidepressants do not improve symptoms in about 40 percent of people, study author Andrea Cipriani of Oxford University told a press briefing.\n\nWhile these results should reassure many people with depression that antidepressants can be effective, \u201cthis does not necessarily mean antidepressants should always be the first line of treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nTalking therapies are thought to be about as effective as antidepressant medication, but these are often much more expensive.\n\nExperts not involved in the research agreed the results were significant.\n\nHelen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the U.K.\u2019s Royal College of GPs, expressed concern about the stigma surrounding antidepressant use.\n\nShe said in a statement: \u201cTaking antidepressants is frequently portrayed as a negative thing or something done only when other therapies are not available or have failed, but this in itself can add to the unfortunate stigma that sometimes exists around people with mental health conditions.\u201d\n\nBut she also urged caution. \u201cAlthough antidepressants are of proven benefit\u2014as this study shows,\u201d she said, \u201cno doctor wants their patients to become reliant on medication.\u201d\n\nPutting a long-held controversy to bed\n\nCarmine Pariante, a professor at the UK\u2019s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience and spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the study \"finally puts to bed the controversy on antidepressants.\"\n\nJames Warner, an Imperial College London psychiatrist, added: \u201cDepression causes misery to countless thousands every year and this study adds to the existing evidence that effective treatments are available.\u201d", "images":
