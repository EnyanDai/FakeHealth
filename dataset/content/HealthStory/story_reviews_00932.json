REUTERS/Nicolas Misculin\n\nThey found daily supplements of soy germ isoflavones reduced the sudden sweats more than inactive placebo pills after six months.\n\nBut a U.S. expert wasn\u2019t convinced by the results, which run counter to other published studies.\n\n\u201cThe majority of them are showing no benefit,\u201d said William W. Wong, a nutrition researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who wasn\u2019t involved in the new work.\n\nThe new study, published in the journal Menopause, is based on 90 Chinese women. A third of them received placebo pills made of starch, while the rest took soy germ isoflavones, either 84 or 126 milligrams a day.\n\nThey all kept diaries of their hot flashes and filled out questionnaires about various problems tied to menopause, including hot flashes, sweating, insomnia, tiredness and headache.\n\nAt six months, their Kupperman scores \u2014 a measure of symptom severity that ranges from 0 to 63 \u2014 had dropped by more than 40 percent from an initial value of about 25 in the soy groups.\n\nThe number of hot flashes also fell from about 20 a week to less than 10.\n\nWhile the same pattern was seen in the placebo group, it was less pronounced. Their symptom score dropped by 29 percent and the number of hot flashes by 35 percent, according to Dr. Yan-bin Ye of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.\n\nThe work was supported by Frutarom Netherlands, which also donated the supplements.\n\nWong cautioned that the new study was small and that the women involved only had few hot flashes. He said it was \u201chard to believe\u201d that soy would have an effect on these women.\n\nIn one of his own studies, Wong found no effect on soy germ isoflavones among women who took the supplements for two years.\n\nThe standard drug treatment for stubborn menopause symptoms is hormone replacement therapy. But doctors and women have become increasingly wary of that option because of serious side effects such as increased risk for heart attack, stroke and breast cancer.\n\n\u201cIt is something they need to gauge, is it worth the risk?\u201d Wong told Reuters Health.\n\nHe generally recommends exercise and an active lifestyle to women who feel bothered by menopause.\n\nSoy supplements also have side effects such as nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the National Institutes of Health. A month\u2019s supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60.\n\nWong said that in Asia, women tend to think of menopause problems as a natural part of life \u2014 not a medical problem.\n\n\u201cThere is a major cultural difference in how we deal with menopause symptoms,\u201d he mused.\n\nThe new study didn\u2019t find significant hormone changes in women who took soy supplements, and Wong said the compounds are probably safe for women.\n\n\u201cConsuming soy is not bad for them,\u201d Wong noted, \u201cbut it might be a waste of money if you don\u2019t see any benefit.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/wVfw8S Menopause, online January 24, 2012.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120130&t=2&i=564627407&w=1200&r=BTRE80T1PZC00", "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120130&t=2&i=564627407&r=BTRE80T1PZC00&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120130&t=2&i=564627407&w=1200&r=BTRE80T1PZC00", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soy-menopause-idUSTRE80T1WV20120130", "title": "Study clouds evidence on soy and menopause", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Middle-aged women may find some relief from hot flashes and other menopause problems with soy supplements, according to Chinese researchers.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "United States,William W.
