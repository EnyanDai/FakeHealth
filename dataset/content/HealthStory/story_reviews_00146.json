They are a highly effective form of birth control and they can offer protection against pregnancy for up to three, five, or ten years.\n\nThe study is the first of its kind to combine and analyze data from multiple studies to look at the issue. \"We went through all of the relevant human epidemiological data on this topic and narrowed it down to 16 high-quality observational studies of over 12,000 women from all over the world,\" Cortessis says.", "images": ["https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-11/7/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-4260-1510095643-3.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-11/8/16/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/original-19965-1510177409-3.png?crop=1301:681;109,57", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-11/8/16/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-31210-1510177288-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-11/7/18/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/sub-buzz-25406-1510095703-16.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*", "https://pixiedust.buzzfeed.com/v1.gif?source=buzz_web&platform=news_bpager&type=instrumentation&target=javascript&value=disabled", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-10/21/16/user_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane02/carolinekee-v2-26014-1477081869-10_large.jpg"], "top_img": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-11/8/16/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/original-19965-1510177409-3.png?crop=1301:681;109,57", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Kee", "Buzzfeed News Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinekee/iuds-may-lower-cervical-cancer-risk-new-study-finds", "title": "IUDs May Have A Surprising Added Health Benefit", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright BuzzFeed, Inc.
