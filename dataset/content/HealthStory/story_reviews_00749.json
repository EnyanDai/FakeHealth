That number has risen in recent years, but it\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s due to more kids with symptoms or doctors who are more likely to recognize and diagnose autism.\n\nThe new study, which appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association, doesn\u2019t prove low folic acid in pregnant women causes their babies to develop autism, or that high doses can prevent it. And Suren and his colleagues didn\u2019t see an effect of folic acid on other autism spectrum disorders, such as Asperger\u2019s.\n\nThey followed just over 85,000 women and their children, born between 2002 and 2008.\n\nWhen women were about halfway through their pregnancies, they reported on any supplements or vitamins they\u2019d taken in the few weeks before becoming pregnant and the two months afterward - the time when folic acid is thought to have the strongest effect on development.\n\nBy the time their kids were between three and 10 years old, 270 had been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, including 114 with autism itself.\n\nSuren\u2019s team found one in 1,000 babies born to women who reported taking folic acid early in pregnancy had autism, compared to about two in 1,000 of those whose moms didn\u2019t take folic acid. On the other hand, there was no link between fish oil taken during pregnancy and autism risk.\n\nThat suggests it\u2019s something about folic acid, in particular, that influences a baby\u2019s autism risk.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem we have is, how do you know it\u2019s folic acid and not just a more health-conscious mother?\u201d said Cathrine Hoyo, who has studied folic acid supplementation at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\u201cDoing that (analysis) really added another layer toward convincing us that there is something to it,\u201d Hoyo, who wasn\u2019t involved in the new research, told Reuters Health.\n\nBEFORE PREGNANCY, TOO\n\nResearchers said folic acid\u2019s effects on genes and DNA repair could explain its role in brain development disorders in growing babies, including autism.\n\nThe USPSTF recommends all women who are planning to or could become pregnant take between 400 and 800 micrograms of the vitamin daily. The U.S. and Canada have also required flour to be fortified with folic acid since the late 1990s to cut down on birth defect risks.\n\nStill, \u201cThe message for folic acid before pregnancy has been a little bit lost,\u201d said Rebecca Schmidt, who has studied prenatal vitamins and autism at the University of California, Davis.\n\n\u201cIf you are not even just planning a pregnancy, but able to get pregnant, then you should be taking some sort of folic acid supplement,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/JjFzqx Journal of the American Medical Association, online February 12, 2013.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Genevra Pittman", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-folic-acid-pregnancy-idUSBRE91B1HO20130212", "title": "Folic acid in pregnancy tied to lower autism risk", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women who took extra folic acid in the weeks before and just after becoming pregnant were less likely to have a child with autism, in a new study from Norway.", "Author": "Genevra Pittman", "keywords": "Canada,United States,Cathrine Hoyo,Pal Suren,Rebecca Schmidt,US,FOLIC,ACID,PREGNANCY", "news_keywords": "Canada;United States;Cathrine Hoyo;Pal Suren;Rebecca Schmidt;US;FOLIC;ACID;PREGNANCY", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Feb 12 21:20:12 UTC 2013", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2013-02-12T21:20:12+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Genevra Pittman", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-folic-acid-pregnancy-idUSBRE91B1HO20130212", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Folic acid in pregnancy tied to lower autism risk", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Canada,United States,Cathrine Hoyo,Pal Suren,Rebecca Schmidt,US,FOLIC,ACID,PREGNANCY", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-FOLIC-ACID-PREGNANCY", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Folic acid in pregnancy tied to lower autism risk", "sailthru.author": "Genevra Pittman", "sailthru.date": "2013-02-12T21:20:12+0000", "sailthru.title": "Folic acid in pregnancy tied to lower autism risk", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Folic acid in pregnancy tied to lower autism risk", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-folic-acid-pregnancy-idUSBRE91B1HO20130212", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women who took extra folic acid in the weeks before and just ...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2013-02-12T21:20:12+0000", "modified_time": "2013-02-12T21:20:12+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Genevra Pittman", "tag": "Canada,United States,Cathrine Hoyo,Pal Suren,Rebecca Schmidt,US,FOLIC,ACID,PREGNANCY"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Folic acid in pregnancy tied to lower autism risk", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women who took extra folic acid in the weeks before and just after becoming pregnant were less likely to have a child with autism, in a new study from Norway.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1360645200.0, "source": "http://www.reuters.com", "summary": ""}
