It is known as BMS-790052.\n\nBut the study provides the first clinical evidence that targeting the HCV protein NS5A may be an effective strategy for curing patients who are chronically infected with the HCV virus, says Nicholas A. Meanwell, PhD, who is executive director of chemistry with Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\nChronic HCV infection is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure and is the leading reason for liver transplants in the U.S.\n\nThe current treatment for chronic HCV -- intravenously administered peg-interferon and ribavirin -- cures about half of people with genotype 1 who take it. But many patients find they cannot tolerate months of treatment with interferon, which can cause anemia and severe flu-like symptoms.\n\nCure rates are lower for people with HCV genotype 1, which includes about 70% of Americans chronically infected with hepatitis C virus; and they are lower still for people who do not respond well to initial treatment.\n\n\"It is clear that other treatments are needed,\" Meanwell tells WebMD. \"What we are developing, and a lot of other companies too, are small molecule antiviral agents that specifically target the virus.\"\n\nIn fact, no fewer than 90 studies are currently underway examining different HCV-targeting drugs. Two of these drugs, Vertex Pharmaceutical's telaprevir and Merck's boceprevir, are in the final stages of study and may make it to the market as early as next year.\n\nA unique thing about the NS5A-targeting drug, according to Meanwell, is that laboratory studies show it to be effective against all HCV genotypes.", "images":
