To raise awareness about CDE and help other people find relief, the \u201cMy Cousin Vinny\u201d and \u201cThe Wrestler\u201d star has teamed up with pharmaceutical company Allergan and Guide Dogs for the Blind, an organization that trains dogs and pairs them with visually impaired individuals.\n\nAfter toting around eye drops, Tomei said she has found a solution with Allergan\u2019s prescription drug RESTASIS\u00ae, which works by increasing the eyes\u2019 natural ability to produce tears. CDE causes inflammation that can prevent tear production, according to Allergan.\n\nSometimes, individuals with CDE have trouble opening their eyes, but Tomei said she went to the doctor and reported mild but incessant itchiness and dryness, and was diagnosed with CDE.\n\nShe turned to RESTASIS\u00ae because she didn\u2019t want to keep worrying about constantly using eye drops.\n\n\u201cIt was as simple as going to the doctor, getting a prescription and trying RESTASIS\u00ae,\u201d Tomei, 51, who stars in the upcoming \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d movie, told FoxNews.com.\n\nShe decided to partner with Allergan not only because she found the prescription improved her quality of life but also because of the company\u2019s relationship with Guide Dogs for the Blind. On Restasis.com, you can take the brand\u2019s \u201cdry eye quiz\u201d\u2014 for every quiz taken, Allergan has agreed to donate $1 to the organization. When you visit the website, you\u2019ll see a pop-up window with a portal to take the quiz.\n\nTomei, a self-proclaimed animal lover, expressed that the effort is close to her heart.\n\n\u201cA whole world of freedom opens up [for these individuals] because you can move about a city like this (New York City) or anywhere much more easily, and the dogs can become your eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nThe quiz on Restasis.com can help individuals learn whether they\u2019re a candidate for the drug. If you think you may be suffering from CDE, Tomei advised visiting your doctor to receive a diagnosis.\n\nTo learn more, visit Restasis.com.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/meningitis_split.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/lollipop-ban-da-437275.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/life_support_istock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/09/30/640/360/TOMEI6_0.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/09/30/640/360/931/524/TOMEI6_0.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/steamer-horror-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/09/30/640/360/TOMEI6_0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/marisa-tomei-opens-up-about-her-struggle-with-chronic-dry-eye", "title": "Marisa Tomei opens up about her struggle with chronic dry eye", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Oscar-winning actress Marisa Tomei is one of among an estimated 5 million Americans who suffers from chronic dry eye.
