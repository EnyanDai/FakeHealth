The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nThe study, led by Hung Fu Tseng, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, compared about 75,000 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente Health plan with about 225,000 similarly aged members who weren\u2019t vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know how well the vaccine actually performed in the community setting,\u201d Tseng told Reuters Health.\n\nShingles is a viral disease produced by the chicken pox virus, a common childhood disease, and is characterized by pain and a blistering rash along the nerves that have housed the dormant virus.\n\nMost shingles patients are older adults, but people with a weak immune system or those under stress may also develop it.\n\nEveryone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn\u2019t include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended.\n\nUsing electronic health records, researchers tracked patients for up to three years after vaccination.\n\nAbout six out of every 1,000 people vaccinated got shingles each year, compared to 13 of every 1,000 unvaccinated patients. Researchers calculated that for every 71 people who were vaccinated, one case of shingles was prevented.\n\nBut researchers cautioned that because they did not follow patients over the longer term, they didn\u2019t know how effective the vaccine is years later.\n\nDespite the FDA\u2019s approval, the vaccine has not caught on as much as some had hoped.\n\nCost is one hurdle, with the vaccine sometimes costing up to $200 for people whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover it. It also requires stringent storage and handling.\n\n\u201cThe human cost of shingles is enormous,\u201d said Michael Oxman, who studies infectious diseases at the University of California, San Diego, and was involved in a previous study of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cAdult medicine is really geared toward diagnosis and treatment of existing diseases. The adult medical community is not as attuned to preventing disease... as pediatricians are,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/f2Kolv", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shingles-vaccine-idUSTRE70B0US20110112", "title": "Vaccine sharply cuts rate of shingles: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "lifestyleMolt", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews", "description": "(Reuters Life!) - The herpes zoster vaccine could prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles each year if it was offered to everyone who is eligible, with vaccinated adults half as likely to develop shingles, a study said.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,SHINGLES,VACCINE", "news_keywords": "US;SHINGLES;VACCINE", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Jan 12 03:07:26 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-01-12T03:07:26+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shingles-vaccine-idUSTRE70B0US20110112", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Vaccine sharply cuts rate of shingles: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,SHINGLES,VACCINE", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-SHINGLES-VACCINE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Vaccine sharply cuts rate of shingles: study", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2011-01-12T03:07:26+0000", "sailthru.title": "Vaccine sharply cuts rate of shingles: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Vaccine sharply cuts rate of shingles: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shingles-vaccine-idUSTRE70B0US20110112", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Life!) - The herpes zoster vaccine could prevent tens of thousands of c...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-01-12T03:07:26+0000", "modified_time": "2011-01-12T03:07:26+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,SHINGLES,VACCINE"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Vaccine sharply cuts rate of shingles: study", "description": "(Reuters Life!) - The herpes zoster vaccine could prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles each year if it was offered to everyone who is eligible, with vaccinated adults half as likely to devel...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1294801646.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
