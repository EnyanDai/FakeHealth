But the study found that milk collected at night, or night milk, had enhanced sedative effects in mice compared with milk produced during the day. Night milk significantly decreased the rodents\u2019 physical activity, balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk, the research showed.\n\nMice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces, an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam, a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people, the researchers said.\n\nNight milk is rich in tryptophan, a sleep-inducing compound, and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, the study said. Researchers in South Korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow\u2019s milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water. Analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained 24% more tryptophan and nearly 10 times as much melatonin as the day milk. Two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water. The mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments. Mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water-fed controls. Diazepam-treated mice were the least active. Balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a 20-minute period: Mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times, about twice as often as mice given day milk. Diazepam-treated controls fell about nine times, while the water-fed controls fell twice. Caveat: The effects of night milk haven\u2019t been tested on people with sleep problems and anxiety disorders.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
