People with dyslexia have difficulties with reading, spelling, writing and pronouncing words.\n\nAbout one-fifth of people with severe dyslexia learn to read. Hoeft and colleagues wanted to see what was occurring in the brain in these students.\n\nThey studied 45 teens aged 11 to 14 who took a battery of tests to determine their reading abilities. Based on these, they classified 25 of them as dyslexics.\n\nThe team used two different imaging techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, which measures oxygen used by the brain during different activities, and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging or DTI, which reveals connections between brain areas.\n\nThe researchers then showed the teens different pairs of words and asked then to identify which ones rhymed, even though they were spelled differently.\n\nThey found that about half of the children who were dyslexic had extra activity in a part of the brain near the right temple known as the right inferior frontal gyrus.\n\nAnd some of the children with dyslexia had stronger connections in a network of brain fibers that links the front and the back of the brain.\n\nWhen they checked these same children two and a half years later, they found children who had this unusual brain activity were more likely to have learned to read than other dyslexics.\n\nPaper and pencil tests typically used for these children, however, were unable to predict which students would succeed.\n\n\u201cThe reason this is exciting is that until now, there have been no known measures that predicted who will learn to compensate,\u201d Hoeft said.\n\nAlan Guttmacher, director the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, one of the National Institutes of Health, said the finding gives insight into how certain people with dyslexia compensate for reading problems.\n\n\u201cLearning why other individuals have difficulty compensating may lead to new treatments to help them overcome reading disability,\u201d Guttmacher, whose agency funded the study, said in a statement.\n\nThe study is part of a new field called \u201ceducational neuroscience\u201d that uses brain imaging studies to help improve learning problems in children and teens.", "images":
