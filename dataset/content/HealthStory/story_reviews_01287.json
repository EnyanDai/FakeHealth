The risk of lung cancer death was 30 percent lower, the risk of colorectal cancer death was 40 percent lower and the risk of esophageal cancer death was 60 percent lower, the study reported.\n\nThe specific dose of aspirin taken did not seem to matter \u2014 most trials gave out low doses of 75 to 100 milligrams \u2014 but the participants in the longest lasting trials had the most drastic reductions in cancer death years later.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is important as a proof of principle that a single simple compound like aspirin can reduce the risk of cancer substantially,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Peter M. Rothwell, professor of neurology at the University of Oxford. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of work over the years showing that certain compounds can increase the risk of cancer, but it\u2019s not been shown before that we can reduce the risk with something as simple as aspirin.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roni Caryn Rabin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/us/07aspirin.html", "title": "Aspirin Helps Reduce Cancer Deaths, Study Finds", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1259617606084", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/us/07aspirin.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/us/07aspirin.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1259617606084"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/us/07aspirin.html", "title": "Aspirin Helps Reduce Cancer Deaths, Study Finds", "description": "A study comes with a caution against starting an aspirin regimen without a doctor\u2019s advice.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Aspirin Helps In Reducing Cancer Deaths, A Study Finds", "description": "A study comes with a caution against starting an aspirin regimen without a doctor\u2019s advice.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1259617606084, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Aspirin Helps Reduce Cancer Deaths, Study Finds", "pdate": 20101206, "utime": 20141009072020, "ptime": 20101206205538, "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 6, 2010", "dat": "Dec. 6, 2010", "lp": "A study comes with a caution against starting an aspirin regimen without a doctor\u2019s advice.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "07aspirin", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-12-06T20:55:38-05:00", "modified": "2014-10-09T07:20:20-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "top-level-section": "us", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin", "tag": "American Cancer Society"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/us/07aspirin.html", "type": "article", "title": "Aspirin Helps Reduce Cancer Deaths, Study Finds", "description": "A study comes with a caution against starting an aspirin regimen without a doctor\u2019s advice.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Roni Caryn Rabin", "tone": "news", "byl": "By RONI CARYN RABIN", "PT": "article", "CG": "us", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Clinical Trials", "org": "American Cancer Society", "keywords": "Medicine and Health,Aspirin,Cancer,Tumors,Deaths (Fatalities),Clinical Trials,American Cancer Society", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1291698000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
