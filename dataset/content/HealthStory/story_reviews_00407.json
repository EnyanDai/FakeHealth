The guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at 41 weeks and should proceed with it at 42 weeks. But the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies.\n\nThe question was presented in May at the yearly ACOG meeting in Washington: \u201cWhy not induce everyone at 39 weeks?\u201d Two doctors had been asked to debate: Errol Norwitz, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Charles Lockwood, dean of the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida.\n\n[Here\u2019s what\u2019s being done to lower the maternal death rate]\n\n\u201cMy original assumption when asked to participate in this debate,\u201d Lockwood said, \u201cwas that Dr. Norwitz would take the \u2018pro\u2019 side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after 38 weeks, and I would take the \u2018con\u2019 side since older literature suggested that C-section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at 39 weeks.\u201d\n\nCharles J. Lockwood found studies suggesting that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce complications in mothers and infants. (University of South Florida)\n\nNorwitz was a vigorous proponent. \u201cThere is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,\u201d he told the doctors. And as Lockwood reviewed research, he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view.\n\n\u201cBut Errol and I decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cBeyond adding an element of suspense, this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions.\u201d\n\nAfter Lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications, what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction.\n\nBefore either doctor spoke, the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled: 63 percent opposed having most women deliver at 39 weeks, 20 percent supported it and 17 percent were unsure.\n\nNorwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course.\n\n\u201cNature is a terrible obstetrician,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201ccontinuum\u201d of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth.\n\nAnd, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. \u201cStillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,\u201d said Errol Norwitz, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine. (Tufts Medical Center)\n\nLockwood and Norwitz\u2019s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby.\n\nLabor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin, which can set off contractions. Labor can begin immediately or take a day or two; if it becomes too lengthy, Caesareans are performed.\n\nCristen Pascucci, an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions, thinks the doctors\u2019 remarks suggest that all babies need to be \u201crescued by birth,\u201d creating an anti-woman mentality. \u201cIt\u2019s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design,\u201d said Pascucci, a vice president of the advocacy group Improving Birth.\n\nPascucci, who is based in Lexington, Ky., travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights. She said the induction recommendation \u201creinforces a century-old, pre-feminist American obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor\u2019s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator \u2014 like in the \u201950s, when every baby was pulled out of its shackled, unconscious mother by episiotomy.\u201d\n\nConsumer groups such as hers, she said, have been calling on ACOG to evolve toward care that is more centered on women. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to see how hard that\u2019s going to be for some physicians to do.\u201d\n\nLockwood and Norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at 39 weeks. \u201cI think a lot of this gets very emotional,\u201d Norwitz said.\n\nAlthough both doctors support induction at 39 weeks for all healthy pregnancies, Lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn\u2019t routinely adopt the practice just yet. As with any change in standard medical care, extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted. Even so, Norwitz thinks that \u201cit\u2019s a very healthy discussion to have.\u201d\n\nDue dates are calculated 40 weeks from the first day of a woman\u2019s normal menstrual period and, according to ACOG, full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.\n\nAs he prepared for the debate, Lockwood created a micro-simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions, and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth, Caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at 39 weeks. That prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction.\n\nStill, he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion: 70 percent now supported the idea that women deliver at 39 weeks, 21 percent remained unsure and only 9 percent were against the idea.\n\n[I didn\u2019t understand the pressure to have a C-section until I was about to deliver]\n\nTraditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a Caesarean. But Norwitz said the evidence doesn\u2019t support that. Rather, he said, the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the Caesarean risk, adding a small caveat: For a small number of first-time mothers with \u201cunfavorable, long and hard cervixes\u201d \u2014 as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction \u2014 the risk of Caesarean is increased.\n\nRebecca Dekker, who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website Evidence Based Birth, which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals, watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed. She called it \u201cconcerning and rash\u201d for doctors at the meeting to make \u201cbroad conclusions\u201d that \u201ccould potentially affect at least 3 million women a year in the United States alone.\u201d\n\nNorwitz said that the presentations were evidence-based. \u201cThis is my interpretation of the published literature,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology.\u201d\n\nLockwood said he finds push-back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process.\n\nDekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of Caesarean delivery. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. \u201cThey still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor, so it sways the results of the studies,\u201d she said.\n\nDekker isn\u2019t disputing that there are about 25,000 stillbirths per year or that this is a concern. However, she said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy, and the other half at later points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,\u201d Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, \u201cDespite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.\u201d\n\nAnd, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Pitocin, the most commonly used drug for induction, is classified as a high-alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs. The drug can cause contractions that are too frequent, increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby, she said. Also, the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, and it can cause the uterine wall to tear.\n\nFor Dekker, the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction.\n\nThere are clear philosophical differences. One early morning in his hospital\u2019s labor and delivery unit, Norwitz said, he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest. \u201cWe midwives stand behind the patient, and if she gets off the path, we coax her back onto it,\u201d she told him. \u201cObstetricians are in front of her, hacking through the forest.\u201d\n\nEsther Hausman, a certified nurse midwife in Concord, Mass., argues for restraint. \u201cSince we don\u2019t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?\u201d\n\nHausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States. In a 2014 CDC report, the U.S. infant mortality rate (6.1 per 1,000 births) put it in 26th place among a selection of developed countries. Finland and Japan had the lowest rates (2.3 per 1,000 births.)\n\nDekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care. Midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively, she said, and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more-satisfied patients.\n\nBeverly Siegal, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Newton, Mass., attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction.\n\n\u201cWhat changed [my opinion] at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond 39 weeks,\u201d Siegal said. \u201cI would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at 39 weeks be encouraged to get induced.\u201d\n\nOf course, Lockwood said, women should be heard.\n\n\u201cFinally, needless to say, it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut obviously our messages \u2014 how you talk \u2014 does make a difference,\u201d Norwitz said.", "images": ["https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/06/23/Health-Environment-Science/Images/INDUCEDLABOR31466704210.jpg?uuid=8aAsJDlqEeavAh31Xwx3_w", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/01/Health-Environment-Science/Images/iStock_000003006862_Large1454367491.jpg?t=20170517", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/06/24/Health-Environment-Science/Images/Norwitz_Errol_300x420px41466787790.jpg?uuid=igMVrjotEeavAh31Xwx3_w", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/01/Health-Environment-Science/Images/iStock_000003006862_Large1454367491.jpg?uuid=RUV7xsk3EeW5qyZZEQS7GQ"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/01/Health-Environment-Science/Images/iStock_000003006862_Large1454367491.jpg?t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Margulies", "June", "Megan Margulies Is A Writer", "Wife"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/should-pregnant-women-be-induced-at-39-weeks/2016/06/27/e1bb9d16-27fe-11e6-b989-4e5479715b54_story.html", "title": "Should pregnant women be induced at 39 weeks?", "meta_data": {"eomportal-uuid": "e1bb9d16-27fe-11e6-b989-4e5479715b54", "object-hash": 1573453142, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": "labor, delivery, pregnancy, induction, csection, 39 weeks, full turn, baby, c-section, ACOG, oxytocin,", "news_keywords": "labor, delivery, pregnancy, induction, csection, 39 weeks, full turn, baby, c-section, ACOG, oxytocin,", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@meganmargulies"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/should-pregnant-women-be-induced-at-39-weeks/2016/06/27/e1bb9d16-27fe-11e6-b989-4e5479715b54_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/01/Health-Environment-Science/Images/iStock_000003006862_Large1454367491.jpg?t=20170517", "title": "Should pregnant women be induced at 39 weeks?", "description": "Experts say there are good reasons not to wait in uncomplicated pregnancies."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "description": "Experts say there are good reasons not to wait in uncomplicated pregnancies.", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1467000000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
