But I walked out being told they couldn't find any cancer cells in my body. When you've already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it's unnerving.\" - Bill Ludwig, 70, Penn\u2019s first T-cell patient. DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer\n\nFour years ago, University of Pennsylvania researchers published early but electrifying results. An experimental T-cell therapy eradicated end-stage leukemia in two patients, and put a third in remission. Soon after that, pharmaceutical giant Novartis partnered with Penn, aiming to commercialize the breakthrough. Since then, a more modest picture of success has emerged in treating the blood cancer, a type called chronic lymphocytic leukemia that usually strikes in middle age or later. Of the first 14 CLL patients given the T-cell therapy, four had their cancers disappear - including the first two, who are now about five years cancer-free. Four others got better but then their cancer progressed. And six had no response to the T-cell therapy.\n\nIn addition to those results, published last week in Science Translational Medicine, the Penn team has orally presented data for a total of 38 CLL patients.\n\nCancer disappeared in nine (24 percent), and temporarily regressed in another nine.\n\nCLL typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia, and may be held in check for years with chemotherapy.\n\nIn comparison, Penn's T-cell therapy has been spectacularly effective in more than 50 children and adults with a fast-progressing type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Long-lasting, complete remissions have occurred in more than 60 percent of patients.\n\nOther major centers that are developing T-cell therapies, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and the National Cancer Institute, also have found that the approach works far better in ALL than CLL.\n\nThe method is complex and costly, and often triggers life-threatening complications. It involves genetically engineering each patient's disease-fighting T cells to recognize and attack their cancer cells.\n\nWhen it works, the therapy also offers the hope of a rarity in terminal-stage cancer: a onetime curative treatment. Stem-cell transplantation, a risky, last-resort treatment that can sometimes be curative, is not a suitable option for most patients with CLL.\n\n\"The field of CLL is exploding now,\" said Penn leukemia specialist David L. Porter, the director of blood and bone marrow transplantation. \"At the very limit of this [T-cell] treatment, one could consider it like a stem-cell transplant. It's a highly technical approach, but it clearly has a role for a select group of patients. There is something very attractive about a once-and-done therapy.\"\n\nWalter J. Urba, director of research at Providence Cancer Center in Portland, Ore., wrote an editorial four years ago cautioning that only wider testing would show whether Penn's \"impressive\" initial results were \"an authentic advance\" for CLL.\n\nLast week, Urba said Penn's T-cell therapy \"remains very exciting,\" despite the costs and toxic side effects.\n\n\"Everything we do in oncology is a risk-benefit balance,\" Urba said. \"I suspect that over time we'll have better T-cell therapies, maybe given with other immune therapies.\"\n\nIndeed, Penn and other centers have begun testing next-generation T cells in more blood malignancies including lymphomas, and against the ultimate biological challenge - solid tumor cancers.\n\nFor Penn's very first T-cell patient, Bill Ludwig, 70, the pace of progress is thrilling, humbling, and yet, a bit of a letdown.\n\nThe retired corrections officer from Bridgeton, N.J., was losing his decadelong battle with CLL when he agreed to try the novel therapy in August 2010.\n\n\"I didn't hesitate because I had no options left,\" he recalled last week. \"And also, these people at Penn had been so wonderful to me and my family for 10 years. I felt obligated to say yes. Did I ever think it would be successful? Not in a million years.\"\n\nHe suffered catastrophic side effects as his immune system went into overdrive and his body struggled to eliminate seven pounds worth of dead cancer cells.\n\n\"I was in intensive care, with all my major organs shutting down,\" he said. \"My lower extremities were twice the size they should have been. They called my wife and said, 'He's not going to see the sunrise.' \"\n\nThey were wrong.\n\n\"I was a skeleton when I walked out\" a month later, he said. \"But I walked out being told they couldn't find any cancer cells in my body. When you've already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it's unnerving.\"\n\nLudwig and his wife have since bought a recreational vehicle and traveled the country, seen grandchildren graduate high school, and welcomed three great-grandchildren.\n\nStill, he can't help feeling disappointed that the phenomenal early success of the therapy was just that.\n\n\"When two out of three are successful, you think maybe it will be 9 out of 10, or 19 out of 20. I figured if they can cure me, they can cure everyone.\"\n\nHe corrected himself: \"They've never said 'cured.' But 'cancer-free' works for me.\"\n\nmmccullough@phillynews.com\n\n215-854-2720\n\n@repopter", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/istock-psychedelic.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/social-media-icons-facebook.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/20130429_raine_600.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/https://dc.arrivalist.com/px/?pixel_id=978&a_source=TravelZoo_Affiliates&a_medium=Travel_Deals&a_campaign=TravelZoo_Affiliates_CPC", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/mgparent09z-600.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/LIFE_HEALTH-CANCER-CELLS_MYO.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/social-media-icons-google.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/150*112/virginia-travel-deal.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/HE1TCELL06.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/footer-dn-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/N23rd-600.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/social-media-icons-twitter.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/Z1POLA02C.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/istock-lazy-kid.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://s.clickability.com/s?19=990&14=0&6=325198321&7=168131&25=0&18=0.1669256880224712", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/081215-ertz-zach-600.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/pcLetterIcon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/090915_negotiate_bills_600.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://view.atdmt.com/CBN/view/436905017/direct;wi.1;hi.1/01/?href=http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=3&c2=6036110&c3=AMTR-AMT-004-01-CBN&c4=314588103_509810_2&c5=436905017&c6=&c10=1&c11=&c13=&c16=atls&cj=1&ax_fwd=1&rn=123456", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/pcom_homeIcon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/footer-philly-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6034697&c3=&c4=www.philly.com/philly/health/20150907_T-cell_therapy_results_more_modest_than_hoped_for_chronic_leukemia.html&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/obesity2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/travelzoo-logo-139x351.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/phillydotcom-default-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/partnerIcon-Inquirer-2014.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/108*81/ColbertBush.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/header-search-btn.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/navigation-icon-newsletters.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/footer-inquirer-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/designimages/navigation-icon-newsletters.png?ffh"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/HE1TCELL06.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marie Mccullough"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117/http://www.philly.com/philly/health/cancer/20150907_T-cell_therapy_results_more_modest_than_hoped_for_chronic_leukemia.html", "title": "T-cell therapy results more modest than hoped for chronic leukemia", "meta_data": {"sourcepublication": "Inquirer", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "title": "T-cell therapy results more modest than hoped for chronic leukemia", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117/http://www.philly.com/philly/health/cancer/20150907_T-cell_therapy_results_more_modest_than_hoped_for_chronic_leukemia.html", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150909214117im_/http://media.philly.com/images/HE1TCELL06.JPG", "description": "Four years ago, University of Pennsylvania researchers published early but electrifying results.
