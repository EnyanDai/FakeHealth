REUTERS/Nir Elias\n\nThe device, which combines electromagnetic stimulation with computer-based cognitive training, is already approved for use in Europe, Israel and several Asian countries such as Singapore.\n\n\u201cYou stimulate the brain on a biological level as well as on a cognitive level,\u201d Neuronix CEO Eyal Baror told Reuters, saying this double approach created longer-lasting benefits.\n\nThe device, which consists of a chair containing an electronic system and software in the back and a coil placed at the head, has been tested on mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s patients who suffer from dementia but are not totally dependent.\n\nThe system is in trials at Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Patients are treated for one hour a day, five days a week over six weeks.\n\n\u201cWe see improvement lasting for 9-12 months and the good thing is that patients can return and undergo treatment again,\u201d Baror said. \u201cIf out of 10 years the patients have left to live we can keep them at home in a relatively mild state of the disease for three, four, five years, it\u2019s a lot.\u201d\n\nAccording to Alvaro Pascual-Leone, director of the hospital\u2019s Berenson-Allen Centre for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, brain stimulation - or transcranial magnetic stimulation - involves a very low current applied to a specific part of the brain and is approved by the FDA for treatment of a variety of ailments and diagnostic applications.\n\n\u201cThe application in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in combination with cognitive training is novel,\u201d Pascual-Leono said in a phone interview from Boston.\n\nAbout 20 percent of patients experience a mild headache but there are no long-term negative effects, he said.\n\nPascual-Leone, who is principal investigator in the Harvard trial, said that of 12 patients in the study, six received the real treatment and all showed cognitive improvement. Their improvement was significantly more than the average seen in patients taking just medication, he said.\n\nThe study\u2019s results will be submitted for publication in the coming weeks and a follow-up study on 30 patients is planned.\n\nNeuronix received European approval several months ago and has installations in the UK and Germany. In Israel, a few dozen patients are being treated with the device.\n\nThe U.S. trials are expected to run till the end of 2013. Neuronix is also running a trial in Israel for pre-Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nThe company expects to sell half a dozen systems in the second half of 2012 and three dozen in 2013. In Israel, the treatment costs $6,000.\n\n\u201cOur target for becoming profitable is in parallel to entering the U.S. market around 2015,\u201d Baror said.\n\nNeuronix has raised $8 million from private individuals as well as in grants from the Israeli Chief Scientist\u2019s Office and is exploring options to raise more money in the coming year, including the possibility of going public.",
