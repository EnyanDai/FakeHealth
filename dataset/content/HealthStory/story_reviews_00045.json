Several recent studies have shown that even a single dose in adults can lead to rapid reductions in depressive symptoms. However, relatively little research has been conducted into ketamine's antidepressant effects in adolescents.\n\n\u201cAdolescence is a key time period for emergence of depression and represents an opportune and critical developmental window for intervention to prevent negative outcomes,\u201d the authors wrote in the study.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, about 40% of adolescents do not respond to their first intervention and only half of non-responders respond to the second treatment,\u201d they said. \u201cBecause standard interventions require prolonged periods (e.g., weeks to months) to assess efficacy, serial treatment failures allow illness progression, which in turn worsens the outcome. Hence, novel treatment strategies to address treatment-resistant depression in adolescents are urgently needed.\u201d\n\nThe latest study involved thirteen young people aged between 12 and 18 years of age who had failed two previous trials of anti-depressants. Over two weeks the researchers gave them six ketamine infusions.\n\nThey found that the treatment was well tolerated, with the participants showing an average decrease in CDRS scores of 42.5%. Five of the participants met the criteria for clinical response and remission. Of these, three were still in remission after 6-weeks, while the remaining two relapsed within two weeks.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAccording to the scientists, the results demonstrate the potential role for ketamine in treating adolescents with TRD. However, they note that the study was limited by its small sample size, so future research will be needed to confirm these results.\n\n\"The field is excited about a potential new agent for adolescents with treatment resistant depression,\u201d Harold S. Koplewicz, Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to additional studies of ketamine to validate this treatment.\u201d\n\nQuestions also remain regarding the long-term safety of ketamine as a depression treatment, so more information will be needed before broader clinical use.\n\niStock\n\nJames Stone, a Clinical Senior Lecturer from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek that there is \"a lot of potential for the use of ketamine as a second or third line antidepressant where other treatments have failed.\"\n\n\"Although ketamine is potentially a huge breakthrough in the treatment of depression, we still don\u2019t know about the long-term safety, or about how to keep people well from depression without requiring regular ketamine dosing,\" Stone added. \"Further studies are needed to address these questions.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180802154606im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/04/05/image-01.jpg",
