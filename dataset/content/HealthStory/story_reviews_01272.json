predict with 90% accuracy which children with dyslexia will be able to improve reading skills over a period of a few years.\n\nResearchers say their findings reveal activity in specific brain regions during reading that could eventually lead to new treatments for people with dyslexia.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we cannot say which treatment type will each child benefit from,\u201d study researcher Fumiko Hoeft, MD, PhD, an imaging expert at Stanford University, tells WebMD in an email. \u201cBut with more research, and if researchers combine it with intervention studies, then we should be able to identify brain patterns that are predictive of responding to one type of intervention or another.\u201d\n\nShe says in a news release that the study \u201cgives us hope that we can identify which children might get better over time\u201d and that the findings represent \u201ca huge step forward.\u201d\n\nThe discovery of brain regions involved in the learning disorder \u201cmay provide a mechanism for enduring improvement that promotes relatively successful reading development,\u201d according to the study, published in the Dec. 20 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "images":
