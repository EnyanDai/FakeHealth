In May, British researchers reported that patients taking them have a higher risks of liver dysfunction, kidney failure, muscle weakness and cataracts.\n\nAnd U.S. health officials have been watching data that suggests some statins such as Merck & Co\u2019s blockbuster drug Vytorin may actually raise the risk of cancer, although they have saidf this is unlikely.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-colon-statins-idUSTRE69H55R20101018", "title": "Statin drugs may lower colon cancer risk: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Statin drugs may lower the risk of colon cancer by as much as 12 percent, U.S. researchers reported on Monday.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,CANCER,COLON,STATINS", "news_keywords": "US;CANCER;COLON;STATINS", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Oct 18 21:41:29 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-10-18T21:41:29+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-colon-statins-idUSTRE69H55R20101018", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Statin drugs may lower colon cancer risk: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,CANCER,COLON,STATINS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-COLON-STATINS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Statin drugs may lower colon cancer risk: study", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2010-10-18T21:41:29+0000", "sailthru.title": "Statin drugs may lower colon cancer risk: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Statin drugs may lower colon cancer risk: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-colon-statins-idUSTRE69H55R20101018", "type": "article", "description": "Statin drugs may lower the risk of colon cancer by as much as 12 percent, U.S. r...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-10-18T21:41:29+0000", "modified_time": "2010-10-18T21:41:29+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,CANCER,COLON,STATINS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Statin drugs may lower colon cancer risk: study", "description": "Statin drugs may lower the risk of colon cancer by as much as 12 percent, U.S. researchers reported on Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1287438089.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
