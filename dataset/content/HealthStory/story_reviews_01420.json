REUTERS/Jerry Lampen\n\nCancer patients given a moderate dose of psilocybin \u2014 a hallucinogen with effects similar to LSD \u2014 were measurably less depressed six months after a single dose compared with a placebo. Patients seemed somewhat less anxious, they reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry.\n\nThe pilot study of 12 cancer patients was designed to prove that hallucinogenic drugs could be studied safely as a way to relieve the distress of advanced cancer.\n\nIt revives a promising field of study lasting from the 1950s to the early 1970s that suggested some patients experienced powerful and sustained improvement in mood and anxiety from hallucinogens.\n\nResearchers said the studies were abandoned in the early 1970s when hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD \u2014 lysergic acid diethylamide \u2014 became widely used on the streets, leading to strict federal laws regulating their use.\n\n\u201cForty to 45 years ago, the culture was going through tremendous upheaval. These compounds were associated with a very politically active counterculture,\u201d said Dr. Charles Grob of Harbor-University of California Los Angeles Medical Center and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.\n\n\u201cIt was something of a public health crisis. Everything had to be shut down,\u201d Grob said in a telephone interview.\n\nFederal law prohibits the use of the magic mushroom compound for any purpose. If it proves effective among late-stage cancer patients, U.S. regulators would need to make special accommodation for its use, Grob said.\n\n\u2018TIMES HAVE CHANGED\u2019\n\nGrob\u2019s study looked to see whether psilocybin could help ease some of the anxiety of dying cancer patients.\n\nDuring the treatment phase of the study, patients were given a moderate dose of psilocybin and watched closely for six hours. They were told to lie still with their eyes closed as they wore headphones and listened to soothing music.\n\nDuring the placebo phase, each of the 12 patients received a dose of niacin \u2014 a vitamin that raises levels of good cholesterol \u2014 and given the same instructions.\n\nThe treatments were given in random order and neither the doctors nor the patients were told which compound was administered.\n\nAll the volunteers tolerated the treatment sessions well, with no signs of severe anxiety or a \u201cbad trip.\u201d Most patients showed a trend of improvement in their symptoms of anxiety and at six months, and there was a statistically significant improvement on one depression scale.\n\nGrob said the pilot study proved the drug could be studied safely in cancer patients. He said two other academic research institutions in the United States \u2014 Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and New York University \u2014 were doing similar studies using a slightly higher dose.\n\n\u201cTimes have changed and it\u2019s now possible to pick up this research model again,\u201d he said.\n\nAs many as 14 U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and California voters in November will vote on whether to legalize pot.\n\n\u201cI think that is an indication that there has been a very strong shift within society to move away from the old cultural bias and politics of the process many years ago. I think there is a greater capacity to be open-minded and let science dictate our conclusion, not politics,\u201d Grob said.", "images": ["https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100907&t=2&i=198635134&w=1200&r=2010-09-07T120931Z_01_BTRE6860XRX00_RTROPTP_0_DUTCH-MUSHROOMS", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100907&t=2&i=198635134&r=2010-09-07T120931Z_01_BTRE6860XRX00_RTROPTP_0_DUTCH-MUSHROOMS&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100907&t=2&i=198635134&w=1200&r=2010-09-07T120931Z_01_BTRE6860XRX00_RTROPTP_0_DUTCH-MUSHROOMS", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-mushrooms-idUSTRE68532320100907", "title": "Magic mushrooms may ease anxiety of cancer: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "The hallucinogen psilocybin -- known by the street name magic mushrooms -- may help ease the anxiety that often accompanies late-stage cancer, U.S. researchers said on Monday.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "United States,Peter Cooney,Charles Grob,Julie Steenhuysen,Psychiatry,US,CANCER,MUSHROOMS", "news_keywords": "United States;Peter Cooney;Charles Grob;Julie Steenhuysen;Psychiatry;US;CANCER;MUSHROOMS", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Sep 07 12:09:33 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-09-07T12:09:33+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-mushrooms-idUSTRE68532320100907", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Magic mushrooms may ease anxiety of cancer: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Peter Cooney,Charles Grob,Julie Steenhuysen,Psychiatry,US,CANCER,MUSHROOMS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-MUSHROOMS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Magic mushrooms may ease anxiety of cancer: study", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2010-09-07T12:09:33+0000", "sailthru.title": "Magic mushrooms may ease anxiety of cancer: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Magic mushrooms may ease anxiety of cancer: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-mushrooms-idUSTRE68532320100907", "type": "article", "description": "The hallucinogen psilocybin -- known by the street name magic mushrooms -- may h...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100907&t=2&i=198635134&w=1200&r=2010-09-07T120931Z_01_BTRE6860XRX00_RTROPTP_0_DUTCH-MUSHROOMS", "article": {"published_time": "2010-09-07T12:09:33+0000", "modified_time": "2010-09-07T12:09:33+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "United States,Peter Cooney,Charles Grob,Julie Steenhuysen,Psychiatry,US,CANCER,MUSHROOMS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Magic mushrooms may ease anxiety of cancer: study", "description": "The hallucinogen psilocybin -- known by the street name magic mushrooms -- may help ease the anxiety that often accompanies late-stage cancer, U.S. researchers said on Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100907&t=2&i=198635134&w=1200&r=2010-09-07T120931Z_01_BTRE6860XRX00_RTROPTP_0_DUTCH-MUSHROOMS", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100907&t=2&i=198635134&w=1200&r=2010-09-07T120931Z_01_BTRE6860XRX00_RTROPTP_0_DUTCH-MUSHROOMS"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1283861373.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
