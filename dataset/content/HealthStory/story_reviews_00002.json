So, there wasn't, 'What could we do differently?'\"\n\nThe couple then learned about a new way to tailor fertility treatments specifically to the DNA of the mother, using a test that can help couples figure out the perfect time for conception, based on that DNA.\n\nABCNews.com\n\nThe Endometrial Receptivity Test uses a tissue sample to look at 238 genes to find out the optimum time for conception, thus increasing the couple's chance to conceive.\n\nFor Bilson, that time is two days later than the average woman.\n\nDr. Ilan Tur-Kaspa, an OB-GYN and the director of Chicago's Institute for Human Reproduction, described the process as \"personalized medicine.\"\n\nABC News\n\n\"This is what we are trying to do here by personalized medicine,\" Tur-Kaspa said, adding that you can \"make sure\" that \"the uterus is ready, and optimize a time for implantation.\"\n\nThe result: Their beautiful baby Westley, who is now nine months old.\n\n\"We're so lucky,\" Bilson said. \"We're so blessed.\"\n\nABC News\n\nOB-GYN Dr. Jessica Shepherd told \"GMA\" that this breakthrough new treatment is very exciting to the medical community because it offers another avenue for women who have recurrent miscarriages to potentially get pregnant, when it is something they never thought they could look forward to.\n\nThe new technique works by having a doctor take a sample of the women's endometrial tissue, which you can get DNA from, and from that DNA you can tell what part of the cycle is prime time to take the fertilized egg and implant it via IVF, Shepherd added.\n\nShepherd said that the ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over 40, but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum.\n\nOne risk of the procedure many women may not take into account is the emotional effects of it not working and you still miscarrying, Shepherd said. It is a new process and important to go over the risks of the procedure -- which can vary per person -- with your health care provider.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/181214_gma_ronach4_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ivf1-abc-ml-181214_hpEmbed_16x9_992.jpg", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ivf2-abc-ml-181214_hpEmbed_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/181214_gma_ronach4_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ivf3-abc-ml-181214_hpEmbed_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/181214_gma_ronach4_hpMain_12x5_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/181214_gma_ronach4_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/breakthrough-fertility-test-offering-hope-familys-suffered-miscarriages-59811741", "title": "How a breakthrough new fertility test is offering hope for families who have suffered miscarriages", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "The test looks at the DNA of the mother to find the optimal time to conceive.", "keywords": "good morning america, morning news, robin roberts, lara spencer, josh eliott, sam champion, gma", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2018-12-14T06:41:58:533-08", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "How a breakthrough new fertility test offers hope for families struggling to conceive", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "How a breakthrough new fertility test offers hope for families struggling to conceive", "description": "The test looks at the DNA of the mother to find the optimal time to conceive.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/breakthrough-fertility-test-offering-hope-familys-suffered-miscarriages/story?id=59811741", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/181214_gma_ronach4_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "How a breakthrough new fertility test offers hope for families struggling to conceive", "description": "The test looks at the DNA of the mother to find the optimal time to conceive.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/breakthrough-fertility-test-offering-hope-familys-suffered-miscarriages/story?id=59811741", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/181214_gma_ronach4_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,59811741", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,59811741", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/breakthrough-fertility-test-offering-hope-familys-suffered-miscarriages/story?id=59811741"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,59811741", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,59811741", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/breakthrough-fertility-test-offering-hope-familys-suffered-miscarriages/story?id=59811741", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/breakthrough-fertility-test-offering-hope-familys-suffered-miscarriages/story?id=59811741"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
