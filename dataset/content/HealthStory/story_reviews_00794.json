Patients treated with a placebo saw a 1 percent increase in LDL cholesterol.\n\nThe trial, presented here at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association, included 168 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in which a defective gene inherited from one parent impairs the ability to properly metabolize LDL. The disorder is estimated to affect about one in 500 people and causes extremely high cholesterol.\n\nThe most common side effects seen in the trial were injection-site reactions, cold-like symptoms and headache.\n\nAMG145, along with other PCSK9 inhibitors being developed by companies like Pfizer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi and Roche, is a man-made antibody.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deena Beasley", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-amgen-idUSBRE8A418B20121105", "title": "Amgen experimental drug lowers cholesterol in mid-stage trial", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "companies-mrch;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Amgen Inc's experimental drug AMG145 reduced levels of bad cholesterol by as much as 55 percent in combination with statin drugs in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, according to data from a midstage trial presented on Monday.", "Author": "Deena Beasley", "keywords": "US,HEART,AMGEN,Chemicals (Legacy),Switzerland,Company News,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),United Kingdom,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),France,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),United States", "news_keywords": "US;HEART;AMGEN;Chemicals (Legacy);Switzerland;Company News;Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy);United Kingdom;Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);France;Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC);United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Nov 05 18:53:39 UTC 2012", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2012-11-05T18:53:39+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Deena Beasley", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-amgen-idUSBRE8A418B20121105", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Amgen experimental drug lowers cholesterol in mid-stage trial", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,HEART,AMGEN,Chemicals (Legacy),Switzerland,Company News,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),United Kingdom,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),France,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEART-AMGEN", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Amgen experimental drug lowers cholesterol in mid-stage trial", "sailthru.author": "Deena Beasley", "sailthru.date": "2012-11-05T18:53:39+0000", "sailthru.title": "Amgen experimental drug lowers cholesterol in mid-stage trial", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Amgen experimental drug lowers cholesterol in mid-stage trial", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-amgen-idUSBRE8A418B20121105", "type": "article", "description": "Amgen Inc's experimental drug AMG145 reduced levels of bad cholesterol by a...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2012-11-05T18:53:39+0000", "modified_time": "2012-11-05T18:53:39+0000", "section": "companies-health", "author": "Deena Beasley", "tag": "US,HEART,AMGEN,Chemicals (Legacy),Switzerland,Company News,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),United Kingdom,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),France,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Amgen experimental drug lowers cholesterol in mid-stage trial", "description": "Amgen Inc's experimental drug AMG145 reduced levels of bad cholesterol by as much as 55 percent in combination with statin drugs in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, according...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "companies-health -
