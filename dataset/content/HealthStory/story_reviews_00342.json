Now, according to scientists at the University of Colorado, there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant.\n\nThe study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.\n\nWhat she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.\n\n\u201cBased on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,\u201d says Skaznik-Wikiel. \u201cOur study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.\u201d\n\nExactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn\u2019t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.\n\nMore studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn\u2019t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats. (Some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega 3s, but those cases are relatively rare.)\n\nThere may also be other benefits linked to omega 3 fatty acids for the fetus as well, in helping nerve development \u2014 that\u2019s why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega 3 fats. \u201cWe hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes, omega 3 fatty acids are the way to go [for women hoping to get pregnant,]\u201d she says. \u201cBut even without that firm answer at this point I don\u2019t see the harm in supplementing.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/gettyimages-969917426.jpeg?quality=85&w=600", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-670953527.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-670953527.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/gettyimages-168835127.jpeg?quality=85&w=534", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-670953527.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alice Park"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4535182/how-omega-3-fats-may-improve-fertility/", "title": "Omega 3 Fats May Help Fertility", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "fertility, infertility, omega 3, fish oil, omega 3 fatty acids, treatments for infertility, getting pregnant, foods for healthy pregnancy", "news_keywords": "fertility, infertility, omega 3, fish oil, omega 3 fatty acids, treatments for infertility, getting pregnant, foods for healthy pregnancy", "description": "Researchers say that a common fat found in fish like salmon, and plants like flaxseed, may play a role in boosting fertility", "og": {"title": "This Nutrient May Improve Fertility", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4535182/how-omega-3-fats-may-improve-fertility/", "description": "Researchers say that a common fat found in fish like salmon, and plants like flaxseed, may play a role in boosting fertility", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-670953527.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4535182/how-omega-3-fats-may-improve-fertility/", "description": "Researchers say that a common fat found in fish like salmon, and plants like flaxseed, may play a role in boosting fertility", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-670953527.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4535182/how-omega-3-fats-may-improve-fertility/", "title": "This Nutrient May Improve Fertility", "description": "Researchers say that a common fat found in fish like salmon, and plants like flaxseed, may play a role in boosting fertility", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-670953527.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
