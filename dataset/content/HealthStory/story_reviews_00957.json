So miserable that some parents are buying $30 shampoos and other washes that promise to ward off the tiny, grayish bugs.\n\nThe parents get peace of mind that they are doing something. Conveniently for the product makers, there's no way to tell if they kept lice at bay, or if children wouldn't have gotten lice anyway. Makers say sales are growing fast.\n\nNo one tracks the number of head-lice infestations nationwide. The most recent estimate by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1997, says six million to 12 million children ages 3 to 12 get lice each year, though some experts say the incidence rate is much lower. Still, most U.S. school districts report at least one head-lice case a year.\n\nJennifer Crocker is worried her two daughters, ages 7 and 11, could get head lice. Three classes at their elementary school have reported outbreaks of the tiny critters so far this school year. A friend's daughter has already gotten them twice.\n\nThe head louse, pictured, prefers a clean scalp and only spreads by head-to-head contact. Some 'super lice' have evolved to resist chemical treatments to kill them.

The wingless bugs can't hop, jump or fly\u2014they can only crawl. They spread solely by direct head-to-head contact. They don't harm children, but they are awfully itchy.\n\nWhen kids do get lice, beating off the infestation isn't easy. So-called super lice have grown resistant to the chemicals in traditional treatments. Parents may use over-the-counter shampoos or creams, prescription treatments containing pesticides, or visit salons that comb hair and pick out the nits.\n\nZippity Doo's Styling Gel for Children ($9.99) contains lemongrass, Tea Tree oil and other plant-based ingredients. Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel ($11.95) is sold at salons. Lice Shield shampoo and conditioner ($6-$17) contains extracts of citronella, eucalyptus, rosemary and lemongrass. F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal Styling by Anne Cardenas\n\nSales of prescription lice treatments\u2014used once the bugs have taken hold\u2014rose to $73.8 million last year, up 15% from 2006, according to research firm IMS Health Inc. Sales of over-the-counter lice treatments\u2014which include preventive and removal products\u2014grew 11% over the past five years to $78.9 million for the year ended Nov. 27, according to Chicago-based market researcher SymphonyIRI Group, whose figures don't include Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\n\nFairy Tales Hair Care sells shampoos, conditioners and bottled lice repellent sprays through its website and at beauty retailers and hair salons. The company, based in Passaic, N.J., says ingredients such as rosemary, citronella and tea tree oils coat hair follicles, repelling lice.\n\n\"Rosemary is really the first line of defense against head lice,\" says Fairy Tales founder Risa Barash, who launched the company in 1999 out of a salon for children owned by a relative. \"It's proven. It's safe.\"\n\nMs. Barash cites a 2004 study published in the Israel Medical Association Journal showing citronella\u2014an ingredient in Fairy Tale products\u2014repels head lice. Previous research, also done in Israel, showed lice avoided tufts of hair immersed in essential oils like citronella, rosemary and eucalyptus.\n\nIf the products didn't work, \"why would we have such a large following of repeat customers?,\" Ms. Barash says.\n\nMs. Barash says sales of its items, which range from $11 to $30 a bottle, have risen 36% year-to-date, thanks in part to a new salon distribution deal reached with cosmetics titan L'Oreal SA at the start of this year.\n\nBabo Botanicals' Rosemary Tea Tree Lice Repel Shampoo ($15.95) is one of several products promising to fend off lice with rosemary and other organic ingredients. F. Martin Ramin for The Wall Street Journal\n\nLornamead Inc.'s Lice Shield leave-in spray and combined shampoo and conditioner products are sold nationally by Wal-Mart, CVS Caremark Corp. and Rite Aid Corp. Zippity Doo's, a division of Laurus Enterprises LLC, sells its shampoos, hair gels and spray at some U.S. drugstore chains and through the websites of Target Corp. and Walgreen Co. The company declined to specify figures, but says 2011 sales have so far quadrupled last year's total. Newer entrants like Babo Botanicals LLC, Happyheads Services LLC and So Cozy Hair Care for Children LLC sell their products at hair salons across the country.\n\nTerri Pitts, a 42-year-old branding consultant in New York City, has used most of the Fairy Tale products over the past year on her five-year-old daughter. She likens lice prevention to wearing a bike helmet. It's a \"no brainer,\" she says. \"Why should a kid miss school because of head lice?\"\n\nSome public-health experts and school nursing groups are skeptical about the lice-prevention products, citing a lack of formal evidence. The National Association of School Nurses says in a position paper to its members that, based on several research pediatric, dermatology and nursing journal articles, the preventive products have presented \"little scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness.\"\n\n\"There are lots of things that work in the lab, but not in the field,\" says John Clark, a University of Massachusetts professor of veterinary and animal sciences.\n\nRichard Pollack, an entomology instructor and insect expert at the Harvard School of Public Health, estimates that only about 200,000 elementary-school students actually get head lice each year, rather than the six to 12 million children from the CDC's 1997 estimates. In an email, a CDC spokeswoman said its figures were based on sales of head-lice treatments, noting a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics published last year that said the totals were most likely an overestimation.\n\nMost louse diagnosis is wrong, with dandruff or food crumbs confused for nits or eggs, Mr. Pollack says. He says he is skeptical that the lice-prevention products are any more effective than regular shampoos or conditioners.\n\n\"These companies might as well claim that their products repel alligators,\" he says.\n\nThe only surefire way to tell if a child has lice is to spot one of the crawling critters, say experts, who recommend parents frequently check their children's scalps and comb their hair weekly. Girls can wear their hair up and tight.\n\nNancy Polanco turned to the Internet after receiving a letter about a lice outbreak at her 7-year-old daughter's school. She found Zippity Doo's website and started using its leave-in conditioner, shampoo and protective spray. She blogged about her experience, saying lice \"don't like the smell\" of the preventive shampoos \"and are less likely to stick around.\" The posts have drawn more than 2,400 hits, with more readers each day, says Ms. Polanco, a 27-year-old nursing assistant from Windsor, Ontario.\n\nWrite to Timothy W.
