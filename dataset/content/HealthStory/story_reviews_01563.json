They carry a risk of infection and can be risky to remove if they malfunction. But they save lives when the heart stops beating efficiently.\n\nThe new system requires three incisions on the front and side of the chest and no special equipment to implant. It is made by the privately held Cameron Health, founded by Dr. Gust Bardy of the Seattle Institute for Cardiac Research, who led the study. The company paid for the two small studies described in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cThis device provides protection against a problem that affects at least 200,000 Americans a year, is the single leading cause of death, and avoids short- and long-term problems\u201d associated with conventional implantable defibrillators, Bardy said in a telephone interview.\n\nBardy said the device, which is approved for use in Europe but not the United States, goes back to the original design for defibrillators.\n\nEarly defibrillators put the electrodes on the skin, but required too much power to make them truly portable. The answer was to place the electrodes in the heart so the power requirements would be less. With more available power, the shock can once again originate from outside the heart.\n\nThe device costs roughly as much as a conventional implantable defibrillator, but associated costs are less, Bardy said. It can be implanted in any sterile room and a facility with X-ray capability is not necessary.\n\n\u201cIf there is a complication to the system, it\u2019s going to be limited perhaps to bleeding under the skin or infection under the skin. It\u2019s not bleeding in the chest or an infection in the chest, so presumably the costs related to that are going to go down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not going into the blood vessels, and you\u2019re not going into the lung space and you\u2019re not going into the heart, it\u2019s logical that you\u2019re not going to have those often serious complications,\u201d Bardy said.\n\nLong-term use was tested in 61 volunteers. The researchers said the rate of unnecessary shocks was low and it corrected all 12 instances where the heart developed a dangerous rhythm.\n\n\u201cThe device is behaving very well,\u201d Bardy said.\n\nThe research team said a larger study will be needed to prove that the device is as good as conventional implantable defibrillators.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Emery", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-defibrillator-idUSTRE64B5WL20100512", "title": "Below-the-skin defibrillator restores heartbeat", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Threading electrodes under the skin along the breastbone may be safer, and just as effective, as implanting electrodes to shock a fluttering heart into beating normally, researchers said on Wednesday.", "Author": "Gene Emery", "keywords": "United States,Maggie Fox,Stacey Joyce,Gene Emery,Gust Bardy,US,HEART,DEFIBRILLATOR", "news_keywords": "United States;Maggie Fox;Stacey Joyce;Gene Emery;Gust Bardy;US;HEART;DEFIBRILLATOR", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed May 12 20:59:49 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-05-12T20:59:49+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Gene Emery", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-defibrillator-idUSTRE64B5WL20100512", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Below-the-skin defibrillator restores heartbeat", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Maggie Fox,Stacey Joyce,Gene Emery,Gust Bardy,US,HEART,DEFIBRILLATOR", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEART-DEFIBRILLATOR", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Below-the-skin defibrillator restores heartbeat", "sailthru.author": "Gene Emery", "sailthru.date": "2010-05-12T20:59:49+0000", "sailthru.title": "Below-the-skin defibrillator restores heartbeat", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Below-the-skin defibrillator restores heartbeat", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-defibrillator-idUSTRE64B5WL20100512", "type": "article", "description": "Threading electrodes under the skin along the breastbone may be safer, and just ...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-05-12T20:59:49+0000", "modified_time": "2010-05-12T20:59:49+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Gene Emery", "tag": "United States,Maggie Fox,Stacey Joyce,Gene Emery,Gust Bardy,US,HEART,DEFIBRILLATOR"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Below-the-skin defibrillator restores heartbeat", "description": "Threading electrodes under the skin along the breastbone may be safer, and just as effective, as implanting electrodes to shock a fluttering heart into beating normally, researchers said on Wednesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1273697989.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
