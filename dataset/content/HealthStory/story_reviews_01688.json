It does not matter whether the drinks are caffeinated or not, said the study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe analysis does not prove that drinking tea or coffee lowers the risk of the so-called adult-onset diabetes, but it is not the first study to report such a link. And it goes further than other studies, finding that for caffeinated coffee, risk dropped by 5 percent to 10 percent with each additional cup consumed, which the researchers say suggests a causal relationship.\n\nThose drinking more than six cups of coffee a day were at 40 percent lower risk for diabetes than nondrinkers; the figure for those who drank less than a cup per day was just 4 percent.\n\nSome studies have indicated that chemical components of tea and coffee may have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, but the evidence is mixed. \u201cCaffeine can\u2019t be the answer, because you see the same sort of overall response from diabetes with decaf as with caffeinated coffee,\u201d said the paper\u2019s senior author, Mark Woodward, a professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roni Caryn Rabin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22risk.html", "title": "Study Finds Drinking Coffee and Tea Cuts Risk of Type 2 Diabetes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1247466190749", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22risk.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22risk.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1247466190749"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22risk.html", "title": "Study Finds Drinking Coffee and Tea Cuts Risk of Type 2 Diabetes", "description": "Coffee and tea drinkers are less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than nondrinkers, a study found.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "RISKS: Fighting Diabetes With Lots of Espresso", "description": "Coffee and tea drinkers are less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than nondrinkers, a study found.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1247466190749, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Study Finds Drinking Coffee and Tea Cuts Risk of Type 2 Diabetes", "col": "Vital Signs", "pdate": 20091221, "utime": 20141115075621, "ptime": 20091221134014, "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 21, 2009", "dat": "Dec. 21, 2009", "lp": "Coffee and tea drinkers are less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than nondrinkers, a study found.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "22risk", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2009-12-21T13:40:14-05:00", "modified": "2014-11-15T07:56:21-05:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/index.html", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin", "tag": "Medicine and Health"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/health/22risk.html", "type": "article", "title": "Study Finds Drinking Coffee and Tea Cuts Risk of Type 2 Diabetes", "description": "Coffee and tea drinkers are less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than nondrinkers, a study found.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Roni Caryn Rabin", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By RONI CARYN RABIN", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "ZonedBW", "des": "Medicine and Health", "keywords": "Diabetes,Coffee,Tea,Medicine and Health", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1261458000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
