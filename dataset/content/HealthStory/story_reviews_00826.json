REUTERS/David Gray\n\nIn an analysis of 29 studies, they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn\u2019t.\n\nBut patients treated with fake or \u201csham\u201d acupuncture - using retracting needles that don\u2019t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure.\n\n\u201cA doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,\u201d such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\n\u201cThis provides evidence that they would be justified in considering\u2026 acupuncture,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nAcupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia.\n\nSome think it has potential as an add-on or alternative to standard treatment, while others argue any acupuncture-related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them.\n\nThat either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are \u201cwasting their time\u201d - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said.\n\nTo try to help sort out which is the case, he and his colleagues analyzed 29 studies they deemed to be high-quality comparisons of acupuncture, fake acupuncture and no treatment. Those trials included close to 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe with back and neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis.\n\nThe researchers found that on average, people treated with acupuncture reported a \u201cmodest\u201d improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment, and a larger effect compared to untreated patients.\n\nThey estimated in their Archives of Internal Medicine report that about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy.\n\nA typical acupuncture session runs for about $100 and is often not covered by health insurance.\n\nUSUALLY NOT THE FIRST STEP\n\n\u201cI have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture,\u201d said Jongbae Park, head of Asian Medicine & Acupuncture Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s usually \u201cnot their first approach to address the condition,\u201d he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain.\n\nPark, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would.\n\n\u201cI am a biased clinician,\u201d Park told Reuters Health. But, he added, \u201cI would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.\u201d\n\nVickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/MbBLbb Archives of Internal Medicine, online September 10, 2012.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120910&t=2&i=651411279&r=CBRE8891JUU00&w=20", "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120910&t=2&i=651411279&w=1200&r=CBRE8891JUU00"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120910&t=2&i=651411279&w=1200&r=CBRE8891JUU00", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Genevra Pittman", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-accupuncture-idUSBRE88916A20120910", "title": "Acupuncture has limited benefit for chronic pain", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Acupuncture may help relieve chronic back, joint and shoulder pain, according to a new review of the evidence - but some of its benefit is likely due to the \"placebo effect,\" researchers concluded.", "Author": "Genevra Pittman", "keywords": "US,HEALTH,ACCUPUNCTURE", "news_keywords": "US;HEALTH;ACCUPUNCTURE", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Sep 10 20:07:39 UTC 2012", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2012-09-10T20:07:39+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Genevra Pittman", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-accupuncture-idUSBRE88916A20120910", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Acupuncture has limited benefit for chronic pain", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,HEALTH,ACCUPUNCTURE", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEALTH-ACCUPUNCTURE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Acupuncture has limited benefit for chronic pain", "sailthru.author": "Genevra Pittman", "sailthru.date": "2012-09-10T20:07:39+0000", "sailthru.title": "Acupuncture has limited benefit for chronic pain", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Acupuncture has limited benefit for chronic pain", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-accupuncture-idUSBRE88916A20120910", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Acupuncture may help relieve chronic back, joint and shoulder...", "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120910&t=2&i=651411279&w=1200&r=CBRE8891JUU00", "article": {"published_time": "2012-09-10T20:07:39+0000", "modified_time": "2012-09-10T20:07:39+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Genevra Pittman", "tag": "US,HEALTH,ACCUPUNCTURE"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Acupuncture has limited benefit for chronic pain", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Acupuncture may help relieve chronic back, joint and shoulder pain, according to a new review of the evidence - but some of its benefit is likely due to the \"placebo effect,&qu...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120910&t=2&i=651411279&w=1200&r=CBRE8891JUU00", "src": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120910&t=2&i=651411279&w=1200&r=CBRE8891JUU00"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1347249600.0, "source": "http://www.reuters.com", "summary": ""}
