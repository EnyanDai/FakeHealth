Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgery\u2019s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t come across a patient yet who wouldn\u2019t recommend it,\u201d Dr. Twells said in an interview. \u201cMost say they wish they\u2019d done it 10 years sooner.\u201d She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.\n\n\u201cThese patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again,\u201d Dr. Twells said. \u201cThe weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months,\u201d often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.\n\nIn reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Dr. Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients\u2019 health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/14/science/14BRODY/14BRODY-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/14/science/14BRODY/14BRODY-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/14/science/14BRODY/14BRODY-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jane E.
