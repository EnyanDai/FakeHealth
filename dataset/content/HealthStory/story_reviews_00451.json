Ralph Sacco and Tatjana Rundek of the University of Miami in an accompanying editorial.\n\nThe ongoing study, which used previous stroke estimates for comparison, was based on data from 4,789 patients from TIAregistry.org, an international registry designed to follow cases for as long as five years.\n\nIt didn\u2019t include a comparison group, which would offer the best evidence, but it \u201chelps build the evidence base for the importance of getting in for early treatment,\u201d said Dr. Donna Arnett, dean of public health at the University of Kentucky and past president of the American Heart Association.\n\nAny kind of mini-stroke \u201cshould lead you to be evaluated,\u201d said Arnett, who was not involved in the study.\n\nResearch reported prior to 2004 had suggested that the stroke risk is 10 percent two days after mini-stroke symptoms appear and between 8 percent and 20 percent for the 30- to 90-day period after symptom onset.\n\nBut in the new study, Amarenco and his colleagues found stroke risks of 1.5 percent at two days, 2.1 percent at seven days and 3.7 percent at 90 days when mini-strokes were treated aggressively.\n\nOne year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1 percent.\n\n\u201cAlthough this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units, these (newly-reported) risks are substantially lower than expected. Outcomes in this study were at least 50 percent lower than those reported in previous studies,\u201d Sacco and Rundek write.\n\n\u201cThe rate was remarkably lower,\u201d Arnett told Reuters Health. The study was also noteworthy because, over the long haul, patients did a particularly good job of taking the medications they were given.\n\nThe researchers also found that the one-year stroke risk doubled when multiple blood vessel clogs were seen with brain imaging, a large artery was narrowed by heart disease and the patient scored a 6 or 7 on a seven-point scale that assesses stroke risk factors.\n\nMore than two thirds of the patients in the study had a score of 4 or higher but the researchers caution that \u201climiting urgent assessment to patients with a score of 4 or more would miss approximately 20 percent of those with early recurrent strokes.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1MGDlo3 New England Journal of Medicine, online April 20, 2016.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Emery", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-stroke-tia-treatment-idUSKCN0XH2N4", "title": "Aggressive 'mini-stroke' therapy may cut serious stroke risk by half", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
