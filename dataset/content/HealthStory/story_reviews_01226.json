It\u2019s most common in older women, but about seven percent of white men and five percent of black men are affected, according to the American College of Physicians.\n\nIn the new study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, Robin M. Daly from the University of Melbourne, Australia and colleagues randomly assigned men aged 59 to 70 to an exercise program, drinking milk fortified with calcium and vitamin D, doing both, or doing nothing.\n\nThey measured the men\u2019s bone density before and after the study, which took place over 18 months, but they didn\u2019t look at fractures.\n\nAt the end of the study, men who exercised had higher bone density than those who had supplemented their diet with 1000 milligrams of calcium and 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day.\n\nAdding the supplements to the exercise program provided no extra benefit, hinting that the men already had enough vitamin D and calcium in their diets to be able to boost their bone strength through exercise alone.\n\nThe recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 600 IU in adults up to age 70, and 800 IU for older people, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). A 6-month supply of vitamin D supplements can be bought for less than $10, and many multivitamins contain the recommended daily dose of vitamin D.\n\nAs for calcium, the NIH advises 1,000 mg per day for men ages19-70, and then 1,200 mg per day for men older than 70.\n\nTo build bone density, weight-bearing exercise is needed, such as running or weight-lifting, according to the NIH.\n\nIn animal studies, a lack of vitamin D has been linked to several diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and some types of cancer. However, there isn\u2019t enough data to say if vitamin D can help treat or prevent these diseases, Zaidi said.\n\nTo reduce the risk of bone weakening, the NIH recommends not smoking, drinking less alcohol and exercising more.\n\nZaidi said that both vitamin D and calcium are extremely important for human health, so people should follow the previous vitamin D and calcium recommendations.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have it to build a wall,\u201d he said. \u201cAdding more might not strengthen the wall, but you have to take enough to keep the wall strong. Otherwise it might fall apart.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/i4tDqs The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, online January 5, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-extra-calcium-idUSTRE70Q8V020110127", "title": "Extra calcium, vitamin D no bone booster for men", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Taking extra vitamin D and calcium doesn't seem to prevent bone-thinning in older men, according to Australian researchers.", "Author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "keywords": "Australia,United States,US,EXTRA,CALCIUM", "news_keywords": "Australia;United States;US;EXTRA;CALCIUM", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Jan 27 22:42:45 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-01-27T22:42:45+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-extra-calcium-idUSTRE70Q8V020110127", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Extra calcium, vitamin D no bone booster for men", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Australia,United States,US,EXTRA,CALCIUM", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-EXTRA-CALCIUM", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Extra calcium, vitamin D no bone booster for men", "sailthru.author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "sailthru.date": "2011-01-27T22:42:45+0000", "sailthru.title": "Extra calcium, vitamin D no bone booster for men", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Extra calcium, vitamin D no bone booster for men", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-extra-calcium-idUSTRE70Q8V020110127", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Taking extra vitamin D and calcium doesn't seem to preve...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-01-27T22:42:45+0000", "modified_time": "2011-01-27T22:42:45+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "tag": "Australia,United States,US,EXTRA,CALCIUM"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Extra calcium, vitamin D no bone booster for men", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Taking extra vitamin D and calcium doesn't seem to prevent bone-thinning in older men, according to Australian researchers.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1296104400.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
