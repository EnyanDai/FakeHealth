The number could double by 2050.", "images": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/10/17/USATODAY/USATODAY/636754133718361642-GettyImages-164124217.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b8b0abcb585d9841e5193c3d072eed1e5ce62bc/c=0-30-580-356/local/-/media/2018/07/26/USATODAY/usatsports/MotleyFool-TMOT-2622abeb-alz_large.jpg?width=580&height=326&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b8b0abcb585d9841e5193c3d072eed1e5ce62bc/c=0-30-580-356/local/-/media/2018/07/26/USATODAY/usatsports/MotleyFool-TMOT-2622abeb-alz_large.jpg?width=580&height=326&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/2018/11/24/alzheimers-vaccine-aims-cut-dementia-half-may-see-human-trials/2097609002/", "title": "Researcher: Alzheimer's vaccine could cut dementia in half, human trials may be next", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Researcher: Alzheimer's vaccine could cut dementia in half, human trials may be next", "description": "A study outlines advances in research that could lead to a successful vaccine for Alzheimer's, a fatal brain disease.
