Doctors often give Lucentis less frequently, but even if that regimen produces good results, patients must still get checkups every month to make sure their vision is not deteriorating.\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug, which is called VEGF Trap-Eye, \u201cgives us the opportunity to not have to see them monthly,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Boston, an investigator in one of the trials and a consultant to Regeneron. That would be \u201cvery meaningful to patients and their families,\u201d he said.\n\nRegeneron and its partner, Bayer, said they planned to apply for approval of the drug in the first half of 2011.\n\nThe two similar trials involved a total of 2,457 patients who were randomly chosen to receive either Lucentis every four weeks or VEGF Trap-Eye either every four weeks or every eight weeks. In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.\n\nAfter a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.\n\nVEGF Trap-Eye was also \u201cnoninferior\u201d to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron\u2019s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.\n\nRegeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.\n\nBoth VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It sells one drug for a rare disease and has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars from licensing deals with big pharmaceutical companies.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug is likely to face competition from off-label use of Genentech\u2019s cancer drug Avastin. When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis. Still, even with such low-priced competition, Lucentis has sales exceeding $2 billion globally.\n\nMeanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, of Marlborough, Mass., said it would test its stem cell therapy on 12 adults with severe vision loss caused by Stargardt\u2019s, an inherited disease.\n\nThe company has turned human embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells, which will be surgically implanted into the eye. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.\n\nHuman embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.\n\nEmbryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.\n\nIt is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.\n\nDr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body\u2019s immune system.\n\nThere is no treatment for Stargardt\u2019s, which affects more than 25,000 people in the United States. The disease is usually diagnosed during childhood and it causes a loss of central vision, though not usually peripheral vision.\n\nRyan Rapoport of Newcastle, Wash., who has the disease, \u201cbasically went from normal vision to legally blind in seven months,\u201d said his father, Darrin.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRyan, now 10, cannot be in the trial because, for safety reasons, it is confined to adults. Still, Mr. Rapoport said, \u201cIt gives us some hope, because up until recently there was no hope.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/health/policy/22retina.html", "title": "2 Treatments for Retina Diseases Make Progress", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069358992", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/health/policy/22retina.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/health/policy/22retina.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069358992"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/health/policy/22retina.html", "title": "2 Treatments for Retina Diseases Make Progress", "description": "In trials, an experimental drug for macular degeneration succeeded in requiring fewer injections.
