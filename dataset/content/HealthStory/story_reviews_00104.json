New medtech apps put specialist knowledge in patients' pockets\n\nDeep learning networks have already been applied to produce algorithms capable of diagnosing diseases like melanoma and blindness caused by diabetes.\n\nFurther tests are required before this latest method can be used within a clinical setting.\n\nThe researchers concluded: \u201cThe opportunity to one day readily understand the health of a patient\u2019s blood vessels, key to cardiovascular health, with a simple retinal image could lower the barrier to engage in critical conversations on preventive measures to protect against a cardiovascular event.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/lg/public/2018/02/20/retinal-scan-google-heart-attack.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/02/20/retinal-scan-google-heart-attack.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2016/02/02/google-moon-shots-calico-project-loon.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/01/25/fake-news-russia-social-media-facebook.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/01/25/google-moonshot-alphabet-chronicle-cybersecurity.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/01/22/google-artificial-intelligence-ai-pichai.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/02/20/retinal-scan-google-heart-attack.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848/http://www.newsweek.com/google-retinal-scans-predict-heart-attack-812098", "title": "Google Retinal Scans Can Predict if You Will Have a Heart Attack", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "google, retina, heart attack, health, retinal scan, verily, cardiovascular disease,", "fb": {"app_id": 245537789135954, "pages": 18343191100}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848/http://www.newsweek.com/google-retinal-scans-predict-heart-attack-812098", "title": "Google can tell if you're at risk of a heart attack in the next five years by looking into your eyes", "description": "Researchers used AI to predict a patient\u2019s gender, smoking status, blood pressure and age.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/02/20/retinal-scan-google-heart-attack.JPG"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek", "section": "Tech & Science", "modified_time": "2018-02-20T06:21:58-05:00", "published_time": "2018-02-20T06:21:58-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsweek", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Google can tell if you're at risk of a heart attack in the next five years by looking into your eyes", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://www.newsweek.com/google-retinal-scans-predict-heart-attack-812098", "description": "Researchers used AI to predict a patient\u2019s gender, smoking status, blood pressure and age.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220114848im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/02/20/retinal-scan-google-heart-attack.JPG"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "Researchers used AI to predict a patient\u2019s gender, smoking status, blood pressure and age."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519125718.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
