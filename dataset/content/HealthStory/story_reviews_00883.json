For decades, the standard treatment has been \u201ccontinuous positive airway pressure.\u201d A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.\n\nJoseph A. Golish M.D.\n\nBut the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. \u201cC.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.\u201d\n\nNow an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn\u2019t work for every patient.\n\nApproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.\n\nBob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.\n\nThe diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.\n\nHis doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.\n\n\u201cI had this constricted feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie \u2018Alien.\u2019 It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.\u201d\n\nMr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. \u201cAfter I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,\u201d he said. \u201cMy symptoms subsided dramatically.\u201d\n\nProvent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.\n\nProvent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily \u2014 most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep \u2014 but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.\n\nLast year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.\n\nBut not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.\n\n\u201cIt works like a champ in some people and doesn\u2019t work on other people,\u201d said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. \u201cAll sleep apnea is not created equal.\u201d\n\nSome people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn\u2019t work. Nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night, said one of the leaders of the Provent studies, Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.\n\nUnlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.\n\nDr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typically start with a 10-day trial pack that costs $27.50. He has prescribed Provent to about 300 of his patients.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 reason people don\u2019t continue it is the out-of-pocket expense,\u201d he said.\n\nFor now, Dr. Kryger and others say that C.P.A.P. will continue to be the gold standard, and certainly the first option for patients with severe apnea. But for the roughly 50 percent of patients in whom C.P.A.P. fails, Provent may be a reliable alternative.\n\nDr. Surkin said some patients use C.P.A.P. at home, but take their pocket-size Provent patches with them when they travel to avoid the hassle of lugging a machine through airports.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d said Joyce Nemoga, 64. Ms. Nemoga, who lives in Baldwin Harbor, N.Y., has moderate apnea that caused her to snore and gasp in her sleep. She tried C.P.A.P. but could not sleep comfortably with the device.\n\n\u201cEvery time you turn over, you have to take the hose with you,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried it for six months, and I don\u2019t think I had one full night of sleep the whole time.\u201d\n\nA doctor suggested Provent, and Ms. Nemoga saw quick results.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so happy that I found it,\u201d she said.",
