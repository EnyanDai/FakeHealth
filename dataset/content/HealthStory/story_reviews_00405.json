Patients receiving the texts also were more likely to be active and to quit smoking than the patients in the control group, who didn't receive such texts.\n\nRepeat heart attacks make up more than a quarter of all heart attacks in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of these attacks could be prevented by lifestyle changes. But while health systems have gotten very good at treating heart attacks, they struggle to connect with patients recovering from heart attacks after they return home.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of a heart attack, \u201cdoctors dump a lot of information onto patients in a few days,\u201d says Clara Chow, leader of the study, who is director of the cardiovascular division at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney and an associate professor at the University of Sydney Medical School. But after the initial flurry, Dr. Chow says, there is often little follow-up to make sure the patients follow through on recommended practices. \u201cTexts allow us to give support in bite-size chunks,\u201d she says.\n\nThe six-month study in Australia included about 700 patients with coronary heart disease. Half of the patients received four text messages a week generated by a computer algorithm designed to be encouraging and give helpful advice, such as: \u201cHave you gone for your walk today, Jane?\u201d Or \u201cdid you know 90% of people don\u2019t eat the recommended daily intake of vegetables (5 servings a day)?\u201d The other half of the patients received no such texts.\n\nAfter six months, the difference in blood pressure between the two groups was similar to what would have been achieved using a standard blood-pressure-lowering tablet, says Dr. Chow. She says that the differences in body fat and physical activity were also large\u2014\u201ccomparable or greater than [would have been expected if the patients had been] attending a cardiac-rehabilitation program.\u201d The effect on cholesterol level was smaller, less than 20% of what could have been expected if comparing a statin with a placebo, she says.\n\nWhile many previous studies have looked at the effect of text messaging on certain behaviors, this study stands out, doctors say, because it used objective measures, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, rather than relying entirely on self-reported metrics, which could be biased.\n\nEarlier studies also were often conducted on a smaller scale and over a shorter time\u2014three months or less, says Shivan Mehta, associate chief innovation officer at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. The length of the Australian study was important, Dr. Mehta says, because the first six months after a heart attack are a high-risk period during which new health habits are formed. Another advance, he says, is that the Australian study targeted multiple risk factors concurrently\u2014smoking, exercise, diet and general cardiovascular awareness, rather than focusing on a single behavior.\n\nDr. Chow is now attempting to replicate her results with a new study over a longer period and using a larger sample size. The new study will be run from more than 15 locations for 12 months and involve 1,400 patients. And unlike the earlier study, in which patients didn\u2019t have the opportunity to text back, this study will encourage participants to send questions to a health counselor. There will also be more focus on encouraging patients to continue taking prescribed medication.\n\nExperts hope that targeted text messages can also help patients with other severe and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic lung disease and even mental-health illnesses, when patients require continuing support and lifestyle modifications. Texting also may be helpful in countries where patients don\u2019t have easy access to medical support.\n\nMs. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J.
