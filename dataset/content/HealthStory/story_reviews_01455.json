Temel, an oncologist and author of the paper. \u201cWe thought it made sense to start them at the time of diagnosis. And we were thrilled to see such a huge impact. It shows that palliative care and cancer care aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\u201d\n\nDr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and writer who just published a long article in The New Yorker about hospitalized patients\u2019 suffering before death, called the study \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe field was crying out for a randomized trial,\u201d he added.\n\nAlthough the study could not determine why the patients lived longer, the authors and other experts had several theories: depression is known to shorten life, and patients whose pain is treated often sleep better, eat better and talk more with relatives. Also, hospitals are dangerous places for very sick people; they may get fatal blood infections, pneumonia or bedsores, or simply be overwhelmed by the powerful drugs and radiation attacking their cancer.\n\nSaying the study was \u201cof critical importance,\u201d Dr. R. Sean Morrison, president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, said it was the \u201cfirst concrete evidence of what a lot of us have seen in our practices \u2014 when you control pain and other symptoms, people not only feel better, they live longer.\u201d\n\nThere is sometimes tension between medical specialties, since surgeons and oncologists often view cancer as a battle, while palliative care specialists are seen as \u201cgiving up.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It includes the options any oncologist addresses: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation and their side effects. But it also includes how much suffering a patient wishes to bear, effects on the family, and legal, insurance and religious issues. Teams focus on controlling pain, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath and other side effects; they also address patients\u2019 worries and make sure they have help with making meals, dressing and bathing when not hospitalized.\n\nHospice care is intensive palliative care including home nursing, but insurers and Medicare usually cover it only if the patient abandons medical treatment and two doctors certify that death is less than six months away.\n\nDuring the debate over President Obama\u2019s 2009 health care bill, provisions to have Medicare and insurers pay for optional consultations with doctors on palliative and hospice care led to rumors, spread by talk-show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and by the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, that the bill empowered \u201cdeath panels\u201d that would \u201ceuthanize\u201d elderly Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLegislators eventually removed the provisions. In practice, Medicare and private insurers do pay for some palliative care, said Dr. Gail Austin Cooney, a former president of the palliative medicine academy. \u201cBut it\u2019s piecemeal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe billing is complicated, and for many physicians that\u2019s enough of a deterrent to not bother.\u201d\n\nDr. Cooney herself had such care along with surgery and chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in 2008.\n\n\u201cI decided I wanted every drop of chemotherapy they could give me, and it was very painful, dumping the drugs directly into my belly,\u201d she said. She needed powerful painkillers, and also chose alternative-medicine options like acupuncture and \u201cenergy work\u201d for nausea and fatigue.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rigid \u2014 I had my last chemo treatment on Christmas Eve because I wanted it on the day I was due for it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t have completed the program without the psychosocial support.\u201d\n\nPalliative care experts now want to study patients with other cancers, heart disease, stroke, dementia and emphysema. But the National Institutes of Health is under budget pressure, and the other major source of money for medical research, the pharmaceutical industry, has little incentive to study palliative care. This trial was paid for by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and private philanthropy.\n\n\u201cPhilanthropists tend to focus on curing cancer,\u201d Dr. Temel said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t ignore people who need end-of-life care.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Donald G.
