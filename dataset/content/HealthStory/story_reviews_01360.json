Gourlay, MD, MPH, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in a news release. \"Our study found it would take about 16 years for 10 percent of women in the highest bone density ranges to develop osteoporosis. That was longer than we expected, and it's great news for this group of women.\"\n\nResearchers analyzed bone mineral density data from 5,035 women aged 67 or older who had their BMD tested at least twice during the 15-year study period. Their findings are based on the women's T-score, which is a measure of bone density.", "images":
