Without enough data that could be pooled together, it wasn't possible for the Cochrane folks to figure out if anything really works reliably and safely.\n\nMorning sickness is quite common, with most pregnant women getting nauseous early on and around a third throwing up.\n\nUnfortunately, medicines to relieve morning sickness have a checkered history. Remember thalidomide? In the late '50s the drug was billed as a way to ameliorate morning sickness. The medicine, though never approved for use in the United States, led to birth defects in some 10,000 kids in Europe and Canada.\n\nIn the latest look at various treatments, the Cochrane group evaluated studies that examined both pharmaceutical and alternative techniques, including acupuncture, acupressure (a noninvasive variation of acupuncture), ginger, vitamin B-6 and conventional anti-vomiting drugs.\n\nThe studies in the review comprised more than 4,000 women who were up to 20 weeks pregnant.\n\nSounds impressive, right? But Matthews says reviewers found few high-quality studies about any treatment. Also, inconsistencies in methodology from study to study made it difficult to pool the results and draw firm conclusions.\n\nTake ginger. Matthews says different studies used different forms of ginger -- some tried ginger syrup and others used capsules -- at different doses. The comparison groups in the experiments varied as well.\n\nWhat's more, \"people tended to measure the outcomes very differently,\" Matthews says. Most focused on the symptoms of nausea and vomiting, but they measured the symptoms at different times, she says.\n\nAnd here's a biggie: There wasn't much information about adverse effects on women and babies, something everyone would certainly want to know. And there wasn't much hard data on psychological, social or economic outcomes, according to the report.\n\nAuthors of the review found some evidence that ginger, vitamin B-6 and anti-vomiting drugs relieved nausea. But Matthews says the evidence isn't strong enough to make a recommendation.\n\nAll too often, Matthews says, researchers in the field seem to forge ahead without paying enough attention to what's been done before. \"The onus is back to researchers to carry out studies that would stand up\" to rigorous review and that would build on what's already been tested.", "images": ["https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2010/09/08/morningsickness-b5cb6df4a06bee9fe2df16eefc0d7b839142e9db-s800-c15.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesat_sq-cbde87a2fa31b01047441e6f34d2769b0287bcd4-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/up-first.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/05/23/screen-shot-2019-05-23-at-8.46.21-am_sq-7dcea391e7a87ca3569fe3d2047dda0144e5d86f.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-light.svg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/fresh-air.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2010/09/08/morningsickness_wide-dbf5889cd0ce86743d30f2c7aa81bcbb24128bbf.jpg?s=1400", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/morning-edition.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/all-things-considered.png", "https://media.npr.org/branding/sections/health-shots/branding_icon-9d5c5798fbff8351e5c796ffe65e5e8246c166fb.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-logo.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/08/02/npr_planetmoney_podcasttile_sq-7b7fab0b52fd72826936c3dbe51cff94889797a0.jpg?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/08/03/npr_hiddenbrain_podcasttile_sq-270ab642de6948802f485c6ad1f087239ef6e324.jpg?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesun_sq-4a03b35e7e5adfa446aec374523a578d54dc9bf5-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-dark.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/08/03/npr_hibt_podcasttile_sq-98320b282169a8cea04a406530e6e7b957665b3f.jpg?s=100"], "top_img": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2010/09/08/morningsickness_wide-dbf5889cd0ce86743d30f2c7aa81bcbb24128bbf.jpg?s=1400", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Whitney Blair Wyckoff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/09/07/129708094/morning-sickness", "title": "No Cure For Morning Sickness Just Yet", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "1VqzbDm4ukeFVHOoq5LjIKA2fVKZD-EYv8cXZhKXSfU", "robots": "noarchive,index,follow", "Rating": "General", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "date": "2010-09-08", "description": "A scientific review of the evidence for treatments ranging from ginger to acupuncture finds nothing so far has been proved safe and effective in relieving the nausea that strikes most women early in their pregnancies.", "og": {"title": "No Cure For Morning Sickness Just Yet", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/09/07/129708094/morning-sickness", "type": "article", "description": "A scientific review of the evidence for treatments ranging from ginger to acupuncture finds nothing so far has been proved safe and effective in relieving the nausea that strikes most women early in their pregnancies.", "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2010/09/08/morningsickness_wide-dbf5889cd0ce86743d30f2c7aa81bcbb24128bbf.jpg?s=1400", "site_name": "NPR.org"}, "fb": {"app_id": 138837436154588, "pages": 10643211755}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "No Cure For Morning Sickness Just Yet", "site": "@NPR", "domain": "npr.org", "image": {"src": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2010/09/08/morningsickness_wide-dbf5889cd0ce86743d30f2c7aa81bcbb24128bbf.jpg?s=1400"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1283832000.0, "source": "http://www.NPR.org", "summary": ""}
