This study covers primary prevention, or devices implanted in patients who have never had a serious heart-rhythm incident.\n\n\"I was surprised -- I expected [the proportion] to be lower,\" Sana Al-Khatib, lead author of the study and a cardiologist at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, tells the Health Blog. Previous research has suggested that the devices are underused in some eligible patients, she says.\n\nHere's the WSJ story on the study. As the paper reports, the study was released early after an embargo break, and shares of device makers seemed to drop as word leaked out. Analysts at Wells Fargo said in a research note that the study could provoke a decline of about 5% in the worldwide ICD market. Medtronic shares were down less than 1% to $37.10 in late trading, while Boston Scientific shares were down 1.5% to $7.49 and St. Jude Medical shares were down 2.9% to $41.06. Read the WSJ story to get perspective from Medtronic and Boston Scientific.\n\nSome of the patients in the study weren't appropriate candidates for an ICD because they'd been excluded from trials -- such as newly diagnosed heart failure patients who are supposed to first try tinkering with medication levels. Other patients weren't considered appropriate because studies showed they weren't likely to benefit from them, for example, patients newly recovering from a heart attack.\n\nThe authors emphasize that decisions about ICDs will ultimately come down to the best judgment of the physician and patient. But even if some cases fall into a gray zone where a decision to implant an ICD is not based on evidence but is nonetheless \"reasonable,\" not all of the 22.5% of cases identified in the study likely fit the bill, says Al-Khatib.\n\nIn a statement, the Heart Rhythm Society, a professional group for cardiac arrhythmia specialists, says that \"the vast majority of implanting physicians are prescribing ICDs with the confidence that they are providing the best care for their patients.\" The group \"encourages research that will further improve the use and effectiveness of ICDs to improve overall quality of care,\" the statement says.\n\nWhile the characteristics of patients receiving non-evidence-based ICD implants likely contribute to higher rates of in-hospital mortality and complications, those complications are particularly worrisome when there's no likely benefit from the procedure, Al-Khatib says.\n\nThe study also finds that electrophysiologists, who specialize in heart-rhythm issues, were less likely to implant ICDs in patients for whom there was no evidence of benefit. (Read: Specialty Matters When Implanting Defibrillators)\n\n\"The way I look at this is that it's an opportunity for improvement\" and to see if a \"lack of knowledge or awareness of the guidelines is playing a role,\" says Al-Khatib.\n\nAuthors of the study reported receiving funding from Medtronic and other device- and drug makers.\n\nUpdate: Adds comment from the Heart Rhythm Society.\n\nImage
