During the same period, no blood clots were reported among patients who were far enough along in testing to be evaluated in the 101-patient study.\n\nAbsorb, like traditional metal stents, is meant to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of plaque. But unlike the millions of metal stents that are implanted in patients each year, it does not remain fixed in the arteries for life.\n\n\u201cThe trial\u2019s results would be equivalent to an excellent metallic stent - that type of performance,\u201d said Dr. Patrick Serruys, a cardiologist from Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, who led the study.\n\nThe stent was approved in Europe in January, but will not be widely available there until late next year. It was cleared by European regulators even though large so-called pivotal trials have not yet been conducted on the product.\n\nAbbott plans to begin a 500-patient pivotal trial in Europe later this year and to conduct a 2,000-patient trial in the United States by the end of 2011. It hopes to seek U.S. approval for the product in 2015, several years before any competitor.\n\nSerruys said current stents are essentially \u201ccages\u201d that hamper the flexibility of arteries and make them more prone to reclogging as they develop scar tissue and plaque builds up.\n\nHe said Absorb and stents like it will likely be the next generation of stents and ultimately improve outcomes for patients.\n\nHe said bioresorbable materials have great potential for other uses, particularly for stents to repair the pulmonary arteries and aortas of babies.\n\n\u201cThe baby will grow and the biodegradable material will disappear,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be one compassionate use of it, a very serious application. Otherwise, you\u2019d be forced to reopen the baby to remove metallic stents.\u201d", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ransdell Pierson", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-abbott-stent-idUSTRE7322OG20110403", "title": "Abbott absorbable stent shows good results", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Abbott Laboratories Inc's experimental Absorb heart stent, designed to dissolve and thereby restore the blood vessel's natural flexibility, has proven safe and effective a year after being implanted in patients, researchers said.", "Author": "Ransdell Pierson", "keywords": "US,HEART,ABBOTT,STENT", "news_keywords": "US;HEART;ABBOTT;STENT", "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Apr 03 22:22:41 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-04-03T22:22:41+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Ransdell Pierson", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-abbott-stent-idUSTRE7322OG20110403", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Abbott absorbable stent shows good results", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,HEART,ABBOTT,STENT", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEART-ABBOTT-STENT", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Abbott absorbable stent shows good results", "sailthru.author": "Ransdell Pierson", "sailthru.date": "2011-04-03T22:22:41+0000", "sailthru.title": "Abbott absorbable stent shows good results", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Abbott absorbable stent shows good results", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-abbott-stent-idUSTRE7322OG20110403", "type": "article", "description": "Abbott Laboratories Inc's experimental Absorb heart stent, designed to diss...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-04-03T22:22:41+0000", "modified_time": "2011-04-03T22:22:41+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Ransdell Pierson", "tag": "US,HEART,ABBOTT,STENT"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Abbott absorbable stent shows good results", "description": "Abbott Laboratories Inc's experimental Absorb heart stent, designed to dissolve and thereby restore the blood vessel's natural flexibility, has proven safe and effective a year after being i...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1301803200.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
