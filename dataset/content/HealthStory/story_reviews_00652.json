And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians\u2014not neurology experts\u2014will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available.\n\n\u201cIf we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, that would help,\u201d says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, \u201cbut we don\u2019t.\u201d But Petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released Wednesday in the journal Neurology, his Alzheimer\u2019s test has promise.\n\nPetersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment. Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,\u201d he says.\n\nIn the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients\u2019 medical charts\u2014their age, family history of Alzheimer\u2019s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.\n\nIn the next phase they studied the results of the patient\u2019s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nAnd another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease\u2014how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. \u201cWe were a little surprised,\u201d says Petersen. \u201cBut what\u2019s nice about it is that it\u2019s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it\u2019s looking at another aspect of brain function.\u201d\n\nMORE: This Alzheimer\u2019s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer\n\nPetersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes \u2014 a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues \u2014 should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer\u2019s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.\n\nCurrently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer\u2019s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. \u201cWe have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it\u2019s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,\u201d says Petersen.\n\nGet The Brief.

But those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores.\n\nFor now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn\u2019t much they can do to interrupt the process. But they can direct them toward clinical trials of promising new drugs to address Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, which may slow the cognitive decline considerably.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/electrocardiogram.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/kidney-swaps-organ-donation.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/146104159.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/146104159.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/146104159.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alice Park"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/3749130/alzheimers-test-dementia/", "title": "A Simple 3-Part Test May Predict Alzheimer\u2019s", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "alzheimer's, alzheimer's test, dementia", "news_keywords": "alzheimer's, alzheimer's test, dementia", "description": "Dementia is a part of aging, but how do doctors separate normal brain decline from the first signs of Alzheimer\u2019s?
