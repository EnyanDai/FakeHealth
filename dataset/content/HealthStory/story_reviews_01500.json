But it's not the most accurate, according to new guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology that urge doctors instead to use a special type of MRI whenever possible.\n\nThat's a recommendation that isn't winning universal acclaim from doctors, who say CTs tend to be far more readily available and take less time to administer.\n\nAccording to the guidelines published Monday in the journal Neurology, a type of brain scan known as diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography, or CT, for diagnosing strokes caused by lack of blood flow to the brain -- by far the most common cause of stroke, accounting for nearly 90 percent of them.\n\nDr. Peter Schellinger, the lead author of the new guidelines, said his research team reviewed studies dating to 1966 and confirmed that diffusion MRI is considerably better at detecting the severity of stroke damage than a CT scan. That's important because, \"in general, the more you know about a problem, in this case stroke, the better you can react to problems,\" said Schellinger, of the Johannes Wesling clinical center in Minden, Germany.\n\nCT scans are a specialized kind of X-ray that provides three-dimensional images. Diffusion MRI -- a different type of imaging that doesn't involve X-rays -- shows where brain damage has occurred by measuring how easily water flows through the brain.\n\nSchellinger said that there are circumstances in which a CT scan should remain the preferred diagnostic tool -- for instance, when waiting for an MRI would delay immediate treatment with clot-busting drugs and also for patients who can't be screened with MRI because they have a pacemaker or metallic implants.\n\nAt Chicago area hospitals, suspected stroke victims usually are given a CT scan first, followed by an MRI. Changing that might not be easy, doctors say.\n\n\"Does every emergency room in the country have an MRI available 24 hours a day? I would venture to guess the answer is no and resoundingly no,\" said Dr. Shyam Prabhakaran, director of the stroke program at Rush University Medical Center. \"Even in institutions like ours, where we can get an MRI done quickly as the first test, can you do it quicker than a CT scan?\"\n\nDr. Jordan Rosenblum, an associate professor of radiology at Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine, also has doubts about whether hospital practices will change quickly.\n\n\"Maybe we need to adjust our protocols, but it's not as simple as saying we have two modalities, and we've proven that MRI is better, so now we should move to MRI,\" Rosenblum said.\n\nBut once it's as quick to get an MRI done as a CT, Rosenblum said, \"Then, I do see it replacing CT in a growing number of cases.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/pets/Dogs.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/pets/Helmet.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/pets/Pen.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/pets/Cats.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/OAS/banners/searchautos/250x90_new.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/pets/Services.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/zip2save/zip_logos2.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/pets/Other.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/071310health_cst_feed_20100712_20_20_05_49540-106-150.imageContent", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/searchchicago/site1.1/buttons/share.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/sales08.jpg_20100708_13_59_12_58-83-125.imageContent", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/pets/Keys.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/site1.1/logos/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/MB320x90.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/beverly12-castle12_srch_feed_20100712_13_12_20_49244-83-125.imageContent", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/preps/season/designelements/icons/printer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/071310health_cst_feed_20100712_20_20_05_49540-291-413.imageContent", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/preps/season/designelements/icons/email_go.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media.suntimes.com/images/cds/classifieds/classifieds_newspaper.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20100716202013im_/http://media1.suntimes.com/multimedia/sales08.jpg_20100708_13_59_12_58-83-125.imageContent", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "", "meta_data": {}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
