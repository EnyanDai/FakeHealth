There were no complete responses with Yervoy alone.\n\n\u201cThe response rates and the depth of responses are quite impressive,\u201d Dr. Stephen Hodi, director of the Melanoma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and co-lead author of the study, said in an interview.\n\nThe median time it took for Yervoy patients to see their cancer worsen was 4.4 months. But after 11 months, more than half of the combination group had yet to see their disease worsen. Overall survival data was not yet available.\n\n\u201cLonger follow-up will be helpful to see the durability of these responses and what happens to patients who had complete responses,\u201d said Hodi, who presented data from the Checkpoint-069 study at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nYervoy, also known as ipilimumab, had been the first immunotherapy to extend survival in patients with advanced melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. It works by taking the brakes off the immune system to more efficiently attack cancer. Opdivo (nivolumab) belongs to a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system.\n\nIn a separate group of 33 patients with a mutation of the BRAF gene involved in cancer cell growth, the overall response rate was 52 percent for the combination. The complete response rate was 22 percent. That compared with 1 percent overall response rate and no complete responses for Yervoy alone.\n\nThe combination of the two drugs also led to far higher levels of side effects, such as colitis and inflammation of lung tissue, at 54 percent versus 24 percent for Yervoy alone. Patients were also more likely to stop taking the combination of drugs.\n\n\u201cMost of the patients who stopped for toxicity continued to benefit,\u201d said Fouad Namouni, Bristol\u2019s head of development for Yervoy and Opdivo.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Berkrot", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bristolmyers-immunotherapy-idUSKBN0NB1AJ20150420", "title": "Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combo promising in melanoma: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "medical-research;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "A combination of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs that help the immune system fight melanoma led to significantly greater tumor shrinkage than treatment with one of the medicines, according to a midstage study presented on Monday.", "Author": "Bill Berkrot", "keywords": "Fouad Namouni,Stephen Hodi,US,BRISTOLMYERS,IMMUNOTHERAPY,Company News,Health / Medicine,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Corporate Events,Life Sciences,Cancer,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States", "news_keywords": "Fouad Namouni;Stephen Hodi;US;BRISTOLMYERS;IMMUNOTHERAPY;Company News;Health / Medicine;Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);Corporate Events;Life Sciences;Cancer;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Apr 20 12:33:34 UTC 2015", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2015-04-20T12:33:34+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Bill Berkrot", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bristolmyers-immunotherapy-idUSKBN0NB1AJ20150420", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combo promising in melanoma: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Fouad Namouni,Stephen Hodi,US,BRISTOLMYERS,IMMUNOTHERAPY,Company News,Health / Medicine,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Corporate Events,Life Sciences,Cancer,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-BRISTOLMYERS-IMMUNOTHERAPY", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combo promising in melanoma: study", "sailthru.author": "Bill Berkrot", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-20T12:33:34+0000", "sailthru.title": "Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combo promising in melanoma: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combo promising in melanoma: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bristolmyers-immunotherapy-idUSKBN0NB1AJ20150420", "type": "article", "description": "A combination of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs that help the immune system figh...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-20T12:33:34+0000", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T12:33:34+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Bill Berkrot", "tag": "Fouad Namouni,Stephen Hodi,US,BRISTOLMYERS,IMMUNOTHERAPY,Company News,Health / Medicine,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Corporate Events,Life Sciences,Cancer,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Bristol-Myers immunotherapy combo promising in melanoma: study", "description": "A combination of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs that help the immune system fight melanoma led to significantly greater tumor shrinkage than treatment with one of the medicines, according to a midstag...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tentpoles/AdvancingForward/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
