Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal.\n\nThe result was primarily driven by the difference in deaths of 13.7 percent in the placebo group, or 7 deaths, compared with 3.4 percent, or 2 deaths, for the ixmyelocel-T group. In addition, 38 percent of stem cell patients required hospitalization, versus 47 percent for placebo.\n\n\u201cThis is strong evidence in a well-designed trial that we can decrease events,\u201d said Dr. Timothy Henry, the study\u2019s lead investigator and chief of cardiology at Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles. \u201cFor patients, this is a really hopeful thing.\u201d\n\nHenry, who presented the data at the ACC meeting, stressed the need for larger trials to prove the benefit of ixmyelocel-T\n\nFor the treatment, bone marrow is taken from the patient and enhanced over two weeks to increase two types of cells associated with healing. They are then injected directly into the patient\u2019s heart.\n\nWith advanced heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalizations, blood-pumping ability is diminished as the heart\u2019s left ventricle becomes enlarged and weakened.\n\nIf the disease worsens despite all available medicinal and interventional therapies, the only options are heart transplant or a pumping assist device.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to find a treatment for this group of people before they get to that stage,\u201d Henry said.\n\nVericel shares were down $2.01, or 33 percent, at $4.02 on Nasdaq.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Berkrot", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-vericel-idUSKCN0X11NE", "title": "Vericel stem cell heart failure therapy cuts deaths: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "medical-research;companies-mrch;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "A stem cell therapy developed by Vericel Corp helped reduce deaths and hospitalizations in advanced heart failure patients, according to data from a midstage study, potentially providing a treatment that could delay the need for heart transplants.", "Author": "Bill Berkrot", "keywords": "Chad Messer,Timothy Henry,US,HEALTH,HEART,VERICEL,Heart / Cardiac Disease,Company News,Health / Medicine,Heart Failure / ACS,Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,United States", "news_keywords": "Chad Messer;Timothy Henry;US;HEALTH;HEART;VERICEL;Heart / Cardiac Disease;Company News;Health / Medicine;Heart Failure / ACS;Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks;Corporate Events;Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC);Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Apr 04 17:34:45 UTC 2016", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2016-04-04T17:34:45+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Bill Berkrot", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-vericel-idUSKCN0X11NE", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Vericel stem cell heart failure therapy cuts deaths: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Chad Messer,Timothy Henry,US,HEALTH,HEART,VERICEL,Heart / Cardiac Disease,Company News,Health / Medicine,Heart Failure / ACS,Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEALTH-HEART-VERICEL", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Vericel stem cell heart failure therapy cuts deaths: study", "sailthru.author": "Bill Berkrot", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-04T17:34:45+0000", "sailthru.title": "Vericel stem cell heart failure therapy cuts deaths: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Vericel stem cell heart failure therapy cuts deaths: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-vericel-idUSKCN0X11NE", "type": "article", "description": "A stem cell therapy developed by Vericel Corp helped reduce deaths and hospitali...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-04T17:34:45+0000", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T17:34:45+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Bill Berkrot", "tag": "Chad Messer,Timothy Henry,US,HEALTH,HEART,VERICEL,Heart / Cardiac Disease,Company News,Health / Medicine,Heart Failure / ACS,Volatile Shares / Hot Stocks,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Vericel stem cell heart failure therapy cuts deaths: study", "description": "A stem cell therapy developed by Vericel Corp helped reduce deaths and hospitalizations in advanced heart failure patients, according to data from a midstage study, potentially providing a treatment t...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tentpoles/AdvancingForward/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
