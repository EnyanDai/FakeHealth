Medicaid patients in Oregon are receiving the treatment, and at least 18 dental schools have started teaching the next generation of pediatric dentists how to use it.\n\nDr. Richard Niederman, the chairman of the epidemiology and health promotion department at the New York University College of Dentistry, said, \u201cBeing able to paint it on in 30 seconds with no noise, no drilling, is better, faster, cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would encourage parents to ask for it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s less trauma for the kid.\u201d\n\nThe main downside is aesthetic: Silver diamine fluoride blackens the brownish decay on a tooth. That may not matter on a back molar or a baby tooth that will fall out, but some patients are likely to be deterred by the prospect of a dark spot on a visible tooth.\n\nUntil more insurers cover it, patients also have to cover the cost. Still, it\u2019s relatively inexpensive. Dr. Michelle Urschel, an anesthesiologist, was happy to pay $25 to have Dr. Jeanette MacLean, a pediatric dentist in Glendale, Ariz., paint over a cavity that her son Knox, 4, had recently developed.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/science/12CAVATIES4/12CAVATIES4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/science/12CAVATIES4/12CAVATIES4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/science/12CAVATIES4/12CAVATIES4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catherine Saint Louis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/health/silver-diamine-fluoride-dentist-cavities.html", "title": "A Cavity-Fighting Liquid Lets Kids Avoid Dentists\u2019 Drills", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2016-07-11T17:40:18.000Z", "modified": "2016-07-14T12:00:03.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/catherine-saint-louis", "tag": "silver diamine fluoride", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004462008, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/478d70c5-a83c-5f40-994c-140f5dadf431", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/66558e66dd98435b898cf2127bb38d70", "description": "The liquid, an alternative to a filling, can be brushed on a decaying tooth \u2014 a painless and cheaper solution for dental patients.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/science/12CAVATIES4/12CAVATIES4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Catherine Saint Louis", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/science/12CAVATIES4/12CAVATIES4-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": ",Teeth,Fluoride;Fluoridation,,,", "pdate": 20160711, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/health/silver-diamine-fluoride-dentist-cavities.html", "type": "article", "title": "A Cavity-Fighting Liquid Lets Kids Avoid Dentists\u2019 Drills", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/science/12CAVATIES4/12CAVATIES4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "Dr. Jeanette MacLean, left, and a dental assistant, Stacy Serna, with 4-year-old Knox Urschel, before treating a cavity with silver diamine fluoride in Glendale, Ariz."}, "description": "The liquid, an alternative to a filling, can be brushed on a decaying tooth \u2014 a painless and cheaper solution for dental patients."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/health/silver-diamine-fluoride-dentist-cavities.html", "title": "A Cavity-Fighting Liquid Lets Kids Avoid Dentists\u2019 Drills", "description": "The liquid, an alternative to a filling, can be brushed on a decaying tooth \u2014 a painless and cheaper solution for dental patients.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/08/science/12CAVATIES4/12CAVATIES4-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "alt": "Dr. Jeanette MacLean, left, and a dental assistant, Stacy Serna, with 4-year-old Knox Urschel, before treating a cavity with silver diamine fluoride in Glendale, Ariz."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004462008"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/health/silver-diamine-fluoride-dentist-cavities.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004462008", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/health/silver-diamine-fluoride-dentist-cavities.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/health/silver-diamine-fluoride-dentist-cavities.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1468296000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
