Bergenstal said patients who are not achieving their goals with multiple daily injections should consider using a pump and sensor.\n\nDiabetes association guidelines recommend that most people with diabetes maintain A1C levels of 7.0 percent or below.\n\nIn the study, patients on pump therapy saw a reduction in average A1C levels of 0.8 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent average reduction for those who received multiple injections. A1C levels on average decreased to 7.5 percent from a baseline of 8.3 percent in the group on pump therapy, but decreased to just 8.1 percent in the group receiving multiple injections.
