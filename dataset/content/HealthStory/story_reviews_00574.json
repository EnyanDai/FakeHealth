But the new data aren\u2019t final proof of the drug\u2019s benefit\u2014a separate, continuing study due to end in late 2016 is designed to more definitively test its efficacy and safety.\n\nIn other studies, Biogen Inc. BIIB -0.13% announced some new data suggesting that its experimental Alzheimer\u2019s drug slowed the progression of the disease, while researchers said a clinical trial of a Roche Holding AG compound indicated the therapy reduced the volume of a substance in the brains of patients that is believed to contribute to the disease.\n\nResults of these studies were presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference in Washington. The data are largely incremental but were still being watched keenly by investors, who are looking for signals of potential success after years of failed drug candidates in the Alzheimer\u2019s space.\n\nThe drug-industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, recently released a report calculating that 123 experimental therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s failed between 1998 and 2014 while only four drugs made it to market.\n\nLilly hopes solanezumab becomes the first marketed treatment to slow the worsening of the underlying disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s can alleviate symptoms but don\u2019t slow underlying disease progression.\n\nJefferies & Co. analyst Jeffrey Holford estimates the Lilly drug could generate peak annual sales of more than $3 billion world-wide if it is approved for marketing by regulators. A leading theory in Alzheimer\u2019s research is that the buildup of a sticky protein known as beta amyloid in the brain contributes to the disease. Lilly\u2019s solanezumab is designed to bind to amyloid and clear it from the brain.\n\nBut the amyloid hypothesis hasn\u2019t been proven in clinical trials. In two large clinical trials reported in 2012, solanezumab failed to significantly slow the decline of cognition and functional abilities among the overall population of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s, compared with a placebo. Other companies\u2019 drugs targeting amyloid also have failed in trials.\n\nLilly scientists, however, said the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline in a subgroup: patients with a mild form of the disease. The company has continued developing the drug in mild Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nSince 2012, Lilly has continued to provide the drug to patients who received it in the earlier trials, and patients who originally received a placebo in those studies were allowed to switch over to solanezumab. On average, the placebo patients started solanezumab 18 months after the earlier patients.\n\nThe new results showed that the patients who started therapy earlier retained an advantage in cognition and daily function over those who started later, and that this difference persisted for two years.\n\nResearchers said such a finding is consistent with the hypothesis that solanezumab is modifying the underlying disease. Some patients receiving solanezumab experienced swelling in the brain and other adverse events, but researchers said the drug was generally well tolerated.\n\n\u201cHere we have a safe antibody treatment, solanezumab, that appears to benefit mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia subjects,\u201d said Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California, who presented the results.\n\nEric Siemers, an Alzheimer\u2019s researcher at Lilly, said the new clinical data increases his confidence in solanezumab but \u201cwe\u2019ll find out if it works or not\u201d when a separate, continuing study of the drug is completed by the end of 2016.\n\nIn March, Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., announced some results from an early-stage clinical trial that showed its drug, aducanumab, given to a very small group of participants with mild memory problems appeared to reduce the amount of amyloid in the brain. The treatment also appeared to slow down cognitive decline\u2014particularly at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg\u2014in these people.\n\nThe results impressed Wall Street and lifted the company\u2019s stock to all-time highs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates annual sales of the Biogen drug could top $10 billion if it reaches the market. The March findings, however, didn\u2019t include all doses of medication at the 12-month time point.\n\nAducanumab is an antibody that is thought to bind to sticky clumps of the protein amyloid in the brain and causes cells to digest away the plaque and reduce amyloid, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nOn Wednesday, researchers presented Biogen\u2019s full one-year data of all four medication doses at one year of treatment, as well as more participants in the placebo arm of the study. The results were largely consistent with the March analyses.\n\n\u201cI breathed a huge sigh of relief\u201d after seeing the Biogen data, said Mark Schoenebaum, biotech and pharmaceuticals analyst at Evercore ISI.\n\nWith a Roche compound called gantenerumab, new results in a subset of participants of the biomarker and brain imaging data showed that the compound did appear to reduce amyloid plaque as hypothesized, nearly two years after the start of treatment.\n\nA trial of the therapy was discontinued in December 2014 after a preplanned look at the data in the middle of the study suggested the treatment wasn\u2019t making an impact on cognition.\n\nThat means the compound appears to work the way it is theorized to, yet still didn\u2019t appear to influence cognitive decline, raising questions about whether removing amyloid plaque yields a benefit on cognition.\n\nPhilip Scheltens, Director of the Alzheimer Center at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, who presented the data to media, said the findings suggested the doses tested were too low to be effective.\n\nA researcher at Switzerland-based Roche announced Wednesday it is going to investigate a higher dose of the compound in an extension of the trial.\n\nResearchers at Axovant Sciences of Bermuda, whose drug candidate RVT-101 works on neurotransmitters in the brain, presented a new analysis of data from its previously reported clinical trial. These data, which included only the participants to finish the trial, were consistent with previously announced data, which included everyone who started the trial whether they dropped out or not.\n\nWrite to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com and Shirley S.
