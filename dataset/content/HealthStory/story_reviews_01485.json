Now some medical centers are marketing their high-definitioncolonoscopes, which they say will detect more pre-cancerous polyps. Several recent studies have found a small benefit to high-definition colonoscopy over the standard variety, but gastroenterologists say physician technique is more important in detecting polyps than equipment.\n\nColonoscopy, a screening test doctors recommend for most people starting at age 50, allows doctors to remove pre-cancerous growths before they become full-blown cancer. The test involves inserting a thin, flexible tube into the rectum: An image of the inside of the colon is sent to a video screen.\n\nWhile the test saves many lives, scientists say, it is far from perfect and polyps are often missed. \"There is a growing consensus that we need to improve the overall quality of colonoscopies and high-definition is one of the technologies that may help us do that,\" says Michael B. Wallace, chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla. Dr. Wallace receives research funding from Olympus Corp., a manufacturer of HD scopes.\n\nTim Foley\n\nMany hospitals now use high-definition colonoscopes, which are sold by a number of companies. The image is sharper and more detailed, and could potentially help clinicians find polyps they would have otherwise missed. The HD scope made by Japan's Olympus, for example, shows 1080 horizontal lines of data on the screen, compared with 400 to 500 horizontal lines shown by a standard-definition scope, says Frank Filiciotto, executive director of technical marketing at Olympus Corp. of the Americas.\n\nLawrence Cohen, associate clinical professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, says switching to high-definition machines recently increased the detection rate of pre- cancerous growths called adenomas in his four-physician New York private practice to 50%, compared with 42% when using a standard-definition machine. Most of the increase involves small growths, or those with a flat shape that are hard to see.\n\nClinical trial results have been mixed. An 850-person study by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic found that HD colonoscopy did not improve the identification of individuals with either benign polyps or adenomas. The study was published online last August in the journal Digestive Diseases and Sciences.\n\nA 2,430-patient study by researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, published earlier this year in Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, found adenomas in 28.8% of patients examined with high-definition colonoscopy, compared with 24.3% in those examined with standard colonoscopy. Polyps were found in 42.2% versus 37.8%. The scope tested, from Olympus, had both high-definition and a wide-angle view.\n\nThe combination of wide-angle and HD \"does increase polyp detection by a small but significant amount,\" says Dr. Wallace, senior author of the study. Most of the additional growths found were very small, he adds, and it's not known how many of them would actually become cancer.\n\nEventually, Dr. Wallace says, improved detection with HD and other technologies may allow for less frequent colonoscopy screenings\u2014and maybe even a once-in-a-lifetime screen for people who don't have a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors. Currently, colonoscopies must be repeated every 10 years, or more often if polyps are found.\n\nHD colonoscopy doesn't currently cost patients or insurers more than standard-definition scoping. Over the long run, the more expensive equipment adds only a few dollars to the cost of performing each procedure, says Douglas K. Rex, director of endoscopy at Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis, but the additional polyps found may result in more biopsies, raising costs. A number of technologies on the horizon\u2014including blue light that improves visualization of blood vessels in polyps, may allow gastroenterologists to determine if polyps are pre-cancerous without sending them to the lab, he adds. Dr. Rex tests equipment for Olympus and is a paid consultant to the company.\n\nWhen planning a colonoscopy, patients should seek a doctor with good technique. Going slowly during the exam, washing the colon frequently and looking behind folds of skin is more important than the type of scope used, Dr. Wallace says. Ask your doctor what his or her adenoma detection rate is; doctors should be finding at least one adenoma in 25% of male patients and 15% of female patients, Dr. Wallace says.\n\nAn alternative to colonoscopy is flexible sigmoidoscopy, a shorter, less expensive exam which looks only at the bottom portion of the colon, combined with a fecal occult blood test, which looks for blood in the stool. This is a \"reasonable strategy\" for colon-cancer screening, but needs to be repeated at least every five years instead of once a decade, Dr. Wallace says.\n\n\u2014Email aches@wsj.com.", "images": ["https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/fddd6d28f0576a5772474e644a95623747e1cb4b.jpg?5dc9ac40", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/461b35da8a2936ee4a7ca01072773c0d5aa427f2.jpg?5dc9b5ae", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/0d2ffa0d6fff89f02d5a9d5508d5467ad9dbd858.jpg?5dc9aba1", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/487b80633438bb2d561829c2e7f8bccee2c45e0b.jpg?5dc9ab9e", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-AW136_aches_G_20100726190519.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/93d4c0693749e5d6abc5f87d798d3bfdb580948b.jpg?5dc995fd", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/2a7d0786567f18bb6a72f17019cd642c0b51f730.jpg?5dc9b274", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125024?width=111&height=62", "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746?width=111&height=62", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/3f61c934324559d54745fffbed697f2b611fa261.jpg?5dc9b660", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/f600b0a56ee84a4d350fa4e522e51ee27d5fd426.jpg?5dc9aba3", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-AW136_aches_D_20100726190519.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125154?width=111&height=62", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/4a581253a775cca47f02b15ba756a5f4ccf7b8bf.jpg?5dc969b8", "https://images.wsj.net/im-124802?width=111&height=62", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/869c2a340c4c25db5466a6de556da60ae1a2bf4e.jpg?5dc9b4f7", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-AW136_aches_G_20100726190519.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Johannes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704700404575391240651319552", "title": "Is a Colonoscopy More Effective in High-Def?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dj.asn": "i-05d8", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "page.section": "Article", "page.content.type": "Article", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online", "article.template": "full", "page.site": "wsj", "page.site.product": "WSJ", "page.region": "na,us", "article.id": "SB10001424052748704700404575391240651319552", "article.type": "Aches & Claims", "article.type.display": "Aches & Claims", "article.access": "free", "article.headline": "Is a Colonoscopy More Effective in High-Def?", "article.summary": "A growing number of hospitals are offering HD scopes, which they say can detect more pre-cancerous polyps.
