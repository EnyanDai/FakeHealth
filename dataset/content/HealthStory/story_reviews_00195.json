The latest investigation from the US team pinpoints which cells are important and how they might work.\n\nIn the first of a series of experiments in mice, Cai showed that neural stem cells, which are found in a handful of brain regions at birth, disappear from the hypothalamus over time. The stem cells are known to form fresh brain cells in youth, but the process slows down dramatically in adults. Though small, the hypothalamus forms a crucial connection between the body\u2019s nervous and hormonal systems.\n\nTo test whether the decline in stem cells was causing ageing, and not itself a result of old age, the researchers injected mice with a toxin that wiped out 70% of their neural stem cells. The effect was striking. Over the next few months the mice aged more rapidly than usual, and performed much worse than control animals on a battery of tests of endurance, coordination, social behaviour and ability to recognise objects. \u201cBehaviourally mice aged faster when these cells were removed during early ageing,\u201d Cai told the Guardian. The animals died months earlier than healthy control animals.\n\nNext, the scientists looked at what happened when aged mice received injections of fresh neural stem cells. This time the mice lived longer than controls, typically several months more, an increase of about 15%. If a similar extension was achieved in humans, a person with a life expectancy of 80 years could live to 92.\n\nMaximum human lifespan could far exceed 115 years \u2013 new research Read more\n\nHaving proved that it was neural stem cells that were important for ageing, the scientists ran further tests to work out what the cells were doing. They found that molecules called microRNAs, or miRNAs, that are released from neural stem cells were responsible for most of the ageing effects. When the molecules are produced in the hypothalamus, they flow into the clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord and affect how genes operate.\n\n\u201cThe mechanism is partially due to these cells secreting certain miRNAs which help maintain youth, and the loss of these leads to ageing\u201d said Cai, whose study is published in Nature. The next step is to create human neural stem cells in the lab for testing.\n\n\u201cIt is a tour de force,\u201d said David Sinclair at Harvard Medical School. \u201cIt\u2019s a breakthrough. The brain controls how long we live. I can see a day when we are implanted with stem cells or treated with stem cell RNAs that improve our health and extend our lives. I would love to know which brain stem cell secretions extend a mouse\u2019s lifespan and if human stem cells make them too.\u201d", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70420681b7fde739ca852ab9e9b16a3fcb68b7d3/0_115_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8afb243d931c197892f73916da481fab", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70420681b7fde739ca852ab9e9b16a3fcb68b7d3/0_115_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=edefb3bd6e08417673394b69eef2ebb3", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Ageing%2CScience%2CNeuroscience%2CStem+cells%2CBiology%2CMedical+research"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70420681b7fde739ca852ab9e9b16a3fcb68b7d3/0_115_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8afb243d931c197892f73916da481fab", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/26/stem-cell-brain-implants-could-slow-ageing-and-extend-life-study-shows", "title": "Stem cell brain implants could 'slow ageing and extend life', study shows", "meta_data": {"description": "Researchers hope to launch human trials as breakthrough shows hypothalamus controls ageing, with treated mice remaining fitter and living 10-15% longer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Ian Sample", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70420681b7fde739ca852ab9e9b16a3fcb68b7d3/0_115_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=826a61be9b236edcf928cec01cfa08ed", "keywords": "Ageing,Science,Neuroscience,Stem cells,Biology,Medical research", "news_keywords": "Ageing,Science,Neuroscience,Stem cells,Biology,Medical research", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/26/stem-cell-brain-implants-could-slow-ageing-and-extend-life-study-shows", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70420681b7fde739ca852ab9e9b16a3fcb68b7d3/0_115_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8afb243d931c197892f73916da481fab", "description": "Researchers hope to launch human trials as breakthrough shows hypothalamus controls ageing, with treated mice remaining fitter and living 10-15% longer", "type": "article", "title": "Stem cell brain implants could 'slow ageing and extend life', study shows", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/iansample", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Science", "published_time": "2017-07-26T17:00:26.000Z", "tag": "Ageing,Science,Neuroscience,Stem cells,Biology,Medical research", "modified_time": "2018-02-14T20:43:37.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://science/2017/jul/26/stem-cell-brain-implants-could-slow-ageing-and-extend-life-study-shows?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://science/2017/jul/26/stem-cell-brain-implants-could-slow-ageing-and-extend-life-study-shows?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jul/26/stem-cell-brain-implants-could-slow-ageing-and-extend-life-study-shows", "iphone": "gnmguardian://science/2017/jul/26/stem-cell-brain-implants-could-slow-ageing-and-extend-life-study-shows?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70420681b7fde739ca852ab9e9b16a3fcb68b7d3/0_115_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=d0de056414e8530853c3d6a0383667a1", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@iansample", "dnt": "on"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501041600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
