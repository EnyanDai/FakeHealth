You could stockpile the vaccine and wouldn't have this wait to make a new pandemic-specific vaccine,\" she said.\n\nThe vaccine would be an important step in treating seasonal flu, not just pandemics.\n\n\"Flu kills every year. It's not just swine flu. Normally it's the very old or very young that die from flu, but every year there are deaths from influenza A,\" said Gilbert.\n\nIn the U.S alone it's believed about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu-related causes in an average year, according to the CDC.\n\nThe initial results are positive, says Peter Palese, professor and chair of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, but more research is needed before the new treatment is approved.\n\n\"I think it's a very interesting and very elegant approach and the data so far looks very, very good,\" he said.\n\n\"But although the vaccine has been give to humans, unfortunately there is no evidence presented to say if it really results in protection against infection.\"\n\nGilbert agrees more work is required before the vaccine becomes available, estimating a wait of at least five year, but says the results are a fundamental next step in the treatment of flu.\n\n\"It's fairly certain flu vaccines are going to change a lot in the next few years,\" she said.\n\n\"Whether it's this vaccine or another one someone else develops, I don't think we'll be continuing with the type of flu vaccines that we have at the moment.\"", "images": ["http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/images/1.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/images/1.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/mosaic/15x15_PLUS_bt.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/HEALTH/02/07/universal.flu.vaccine.research/t1larg.brid.flu.cells.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/HEALTH/02/07/universal.flu.vaccine.research/tzvids.brid.flu.cells.2.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/icons/btn_close.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/1px.gif"], "top_img": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/HEALTH/02/07/universal.flu.vaccine.research/tzvids.brid.flu.cells.2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susannah Palk For Cnn"], "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/02/07/universal.flu.vaccine.research/index.html", "title": "New research raises hopes in quest to find universal flu vaccine", "meta_data": {"TITLE": "New research raises hopes in quest to find universal flu vaccine - CNN.com", "og": {"title": "New research raises hopes in quest to find universal flu vaccine", "type": "article"}, "description": "Researchers hope a new treatment developed in the United Kingdom will prove vital in controlling future flu pandemics such as H1N1 (swine) flu, bird flu as well as ending the need for annual flu jabs.", "AUTHOR": "By\u00a0 Susannah Palk for CNN", "SECTION": "HEALTH", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489, "page_id": 129343697106537}, "viewport": "width=1024"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.CNN.com", "summary": ""}
