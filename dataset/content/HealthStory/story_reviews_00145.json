Might non-opioid painkillers work just as well as these addictive drugs?\n\nThis study\n\nThe study involved 416 adults (average age, 37) who had gone to an emergency department with an extremity injury causing moderate to severe pain (averaging 8.7 on a scale of 1 to 10).\n\nFor pain, they were randomly assigned to take acetaminophen along with a non-opioid \u2014 ibuprofen \u2014 or with one of three commonly prescribed opioids: oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine.\n\nWithin two hours, all participants reported essentially identical declines in pain, about four points on the scale. Even for people who initially had rated their pain as a 10 (for the worst pain possible) or had broken a bone, there was virtually no difference in pain reduction between those who had and had not taken an opioid.\n\nWho may be affected?\n\nAdults with arm or leg pain caused by a sprain, strain or fracture. Research has shown that even short-term opioid use, such as that stemming from an initial prescription for pain from an injury or surgery, can make people predisposed to a dependence on the powerful drugs \u2014 partly from their effectiveness at relieving pain and partly from the euphoria they produce. Abuse of opioids has become an epidemic in the United States, with opioids now causing 60 percent of drug overdose deaths.\n\nCaveats\n\nData on pain came from the participants' ratings; no information on side effects was collected. The study did not assess longer-term pain reduction.\n\nFind this study\n\nNov. 7 issue of JAMA (jama.com; click on \"Issues\")\n\nLearn more\n\nInformation on opioids can be found at drugabuse.gov (click \"Drugs of Abuse,\" then \"Opioids\") and at familydoctor.org (search for \"opioid addiction\").\n\nThe research described in Quick Study comes from credible, peer-reviewed journals.\n\nRead More\n\nThe drug industry\u2019s triumph over the DEA, even as opioid-related deaths rise\n\nShingles can be intensely painful; it may also mean health problems ahead\n\nStudy finds measurable boost for aging brains from exercise", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7oZqTq50_L7Qojfih-GvTV6YSJA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WDARKKWFXAI6PBF4LYUFY72FCI.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7oZqTq50_L7Qojfih-GvTV6YSJA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WDARKKWFXAI6PBF4LYUFY72FCI.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Linda Searing", "November"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/regular-painkillers-work-as-well-as-opioids-for-sprains-strains-and-fractures/2017/11/10/516de244-c570-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html", "title": "Regular painkillers work as well as opioids for sprains, strains and fractures", "meta_data": {"object-hash": 1510588582, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": "painkillers, opioids, prescription drugs, sprains, strains, fractures, ERs, what provides best pain relief", "news_keywords": "painkillers, opioids, prescription drugs, sprains, strains, fractures, ERs, what provides best pain relief", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/regular-painkillers-work-as-well-as-opioids-for-sprains-strains-and-fractures/2017/11/10/516de244-c570-11e7-aae0-cb18a8c29c65_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7oZqTq50_L7Qojfih-GvTV6YSJA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WDARKKWFXAI6PBF4LYUFY72FCI.jpg", "title": "Regular painkillers work as well as opioids for sprains, strains and fractures", "description": "ERs often provide prescription medicine for such injuries to ease moderate to severe pain."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "description": "ERs often provide prescription medicine for such injuries to ease moderate to severe pain.", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510290000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
