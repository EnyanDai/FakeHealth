He was a highly regarded, successful innovator, so he thought it would be easy to find a company.\n\n\u201cI started looking for companies to help me, but it was a complete failure,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the companies in the United States and Europe and Japan, they have experts, and the experts are surgeons and they said it is absolutely not possible. We would kill the patients on the table.\u201d\n\nHe joined forces with a former Johnson & Johnson executive, Stanton Rowe, who began making the rounds of venture capitalists. But, Mr. Rowe said, their response was always the same: \u201c \u2018We will look into it.\u2019 And who do they call? The surgeons. They told them all the reasons why it won\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nDr. Cohn, the Harvard heart surgeon, said he and his colleagues had good reasons to look askance. They thought it was strange that the old valve would just remain in the heart. They wondered why the new one would not fly off into the rush of blood being pumped into the aorta \u2014 after all, it was not being sewn in. And pushing a valve into an atherosclerotic artery? Pieces of plaque could break off and cause blood clots and strokes. Finally, he added, it would take patients away from surgeons.\n\n\u201cWe were skeptical,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo and a half years later, after Dr. Cribier had practiced inserting valves in sheep, a 57-year-old man arrived at his hospital needing an aortic valve, on the brink of death, with almost no heartbeat. He had so many medical problems \u2014 severe coronary artery disease, chronic pancreatitis \u2014 that surgery was not an option. Then again, no human had ever had a valve put in without surgery.\n\n\u201cI had to ask the patient his wish,\u201d Dr. Cribier said. \u201cHis response was, \u2018Please, please do it.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the most stressful day for me,\u201d he said. Sheep, he explained, do not develop aortic stenosis, and their anatomy is very different. \u201cWe were not sure we could translate it into man,\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/science/22HEART1/22HEART1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/science/22HEART1/22HEART1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/science/22HEART4/22HEART4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/science/22HEART1/22HEART1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/health/heart-failure-aortic-valve-disease-tavr.html", "title": "Building a Better Valve", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-06-20T17:10:58.000Z", "modified": "2015-06-20T17:10:47.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata", "tag": "Older Adults", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003489292, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/0ecfc499-1264-5bd9-b6c3-d87015b48431", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/fb76b64de309452f9ede8ca06cf60b9b", "description": "A new approach to replacing narrowed heart valves allows older and sicker patients to survive treatment.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/science/22HEART1/22HEART1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Gina Kolata", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/science/22HEART1/22HEART1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Heart,,Surgery,,Medical device,Edwards Lifesciences,FDA,Medtronic,", "pdate": 20150620, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/22/health/heart-failure-aortic-valve-disease-tavr.html", "type": "article", "title": "Building a Better Valve", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/22/science/22HEART1/22HEART1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Cardiologists at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania performed a\u00a0transcatheter aortic valve replacement on Herbert Auspitz, 93, last year.
