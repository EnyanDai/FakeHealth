He was cautiously optimistic about the promise of the video feedback approach.\n\n\"Although it would be wonderful if a relatively simple, video-based intervention could reduce the recurrence risk of autism spectrum disorder in later offspring, further studies are needed to examine this very issue,\" he said. Those studies \"will need to include a larger, more diverse sample population and need to look at developmental outcomes over a much longer period of time.\"\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism.", "images": ["http://consumer.healthday.com/images/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "http://consumer.healthday.com/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Preidt"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-health-information-26/autism-news-51/study-hints-that-video-feedback-therapy-may-help-curb-autism-695657.html", "title": "Study Hints That 'Video Feedback' Therapy May Help Curb Autism", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "Research suggests an effect for at-risk babies, but more study is needed, expert says", "og": {"title": "Study Hints That 'Video Feedback' Therapy May Help Curb Autism", "description": "Research suggests an effect for at-risk babies, but more study is needed, expert says", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-health-information-26/autism-news-51/study-hints-that-video-feedback-therapy-may-help-curb-autism-695657.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://consumer.healthday.com", "summary": ""}
