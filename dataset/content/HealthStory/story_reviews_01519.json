But the fact that the fewest recurrences were seen in men who took the highest statin doses is compelling, says senior investigator Stephen J. Freedland, MD, of the Duke Prostate Center.\n\n\u201cStatin users may see their doctors more often and may be more health conscious in general, and it has been suggested that this could explain the observed reduction in risk,\u201d Freedland tells WebMD. \u201cIf this is the case, dosage shouldn\u2019t matter. But that is not what we found.\u201d", "images":
