The research is published in CMAJ, the Canadian Medical Association Journal.\n\nThe new study ''adds to the trickle of evidence that cannabis may help some of the patients who are struggling [with pain] at present,\" Henry McQuay, DM, an emeritus fellow at Balliol College, Oxford University, England, writes in a commentary accompanying the study.", "images":
