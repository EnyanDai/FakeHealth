Michael Lauer, director of the cardiovascular-sciences division at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, wrote in a commentary accompanying the CCTA study, \"We cannot simply assume that just because a screening test predicts clinical outcomes, interventions necessarily will prevent them.\"\n\nThe study of CCTA screening comes as medical experts are re-evaluating the frequency and usefulness of other types of health screening, including mammographies for women and PSA testing for prostate cancer in men.\n\nThe CCTA test isn't currently a common screening test for heart disease, and American Heart Association guidelines recommend against such use of it. Still, Dr. Lauer said such use is likely to grow. The test costs from $600 to $1,000 per patient, researchers say.\n\nDr. Lauer said the heart, lung and blood institute is funding separate studies of CCTA involving patients with chest pain and other symptoms of heart disease to better define how to use the test.\n\nFor now, most doctors assess risk for coronary heart disease using blood tests to measure cholesterol and other fats in the blood, and then in some cases prescribe medication to lower cholesterol. Imaging tests often are reserved for patients with chest pain or other heart-disease signs.\n\nIn a CCTA test, patients are injected with dye and then undergo a scan, which creates three-dimensional images of the heart and blood vessels. The images show plaque and other deposits that often build up inside blood vessels and can lead to heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems.\n\nThe test differs from a coronary angiogram or a cardiac catheterization, in which a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and then guided into the heart to look for blockages or narrowing of blood vessels.\n\nIn contrast, the CCTA scan isn't invasive, and for that reason some medical experts say it has potential to be widely used for screening healthy patients for heart disease. Some anecdotal evidence suggests such screening is happening and becoming more common.\n\nThe researchers looked at patients who weren't considered high risk but did exhibit some risk factors for heart disease. Almost all adults over age 50 likely have some plaque in their arteries, he said.\n\nThe study involved 2,000 patients in South Korea with an average age of 50 taking part in a health-screening program. The study compared 1,000 individuals who underwent a CCTA exam with 1,000 who didn't undergo the test.\n\nIt found 215 patients who underwent the exam had a positive result, meaning they were found to have plaque in their blood vessels. These patients were 10 times as likely to have been sent for an exercise stress test, a nuclear medicine scan or a cardiac catheterization as patients who didn't have the CCTA test.\n\nThe patients also were three times as likely to be taking a statin medication, and four times as likely to be on aspirin therapy, both designed to lower risk of heart attack.\n\nAfter 18 months, the study showed, one person in the CCTA group developed a heart problem known as unstable angina and one person in the non-testing group had a fatal heart attack.\n\n\"Our findings suggest that low-risk patients without symptoms don't benefit in the short term from knowing whether or not plaque has been detected using CT angiography,\" Dr. McEvoy said. \"However, their physicians may be inclined to be more aggressive with prescriptions or follow-up tests.\"\n\nPatients would have to be followed for a longer period to look at whether there's a true difference in heart events and heart-related deaths between the two groups, Dr. McEvoy said.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com", "images":
