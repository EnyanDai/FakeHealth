Scott Turner, professor of neurology and director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center and his team created a purified form of resveratrol, which is being studied in both animal and human studies for preventing age-related conditions such as diabetes and cancer. In a study published in Neurology, he described how they randomly assigned half of a group of 119 men and women to take up to 1,000 mg of resveratrol daily, and the other half to a placebo, for a year. All of the participants had mild or moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAt the end of the year, Turner compared the people\u2019s scores on cognitive tests and assessments of how independent they were in their daily living from the start of the study.\n\n\u201cMy nightmare was that nothing would be different from the placebo group, and there would be nothing of interest to talk about,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that did not happen. I think resveratrol is an engaging target that\u2019s very interesting and could be pharmacologically manipulated to develop a treatment.\u201d\n\nMORE: Red Wine Not That Healthy After All, Study Shows\n\nThe resveratrol group showed no change in the levels of a protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. Turner\u2019s group also measured the protein in spinal fluid and blood, and did not see differences over the year in the resveratrol group. That\u2019s likely because experts believe that as Alzheimer\u2019s progresses, more of the protein plaques form in the brain, and less of the protein is released to the rest of the body.\n\nThe resveratrol group also showed smaller brain volume, which in the case of Alzheimer\u2019s is a positive sign, as the disease can cause inflammation and swelling that can interfere with nerve connections.\n\nMORE: Noteworthy Advances in Alzheimer\u2019s Research\n\nEven more encouraging, the people who were treated showed slight improvements in their ability to maintain certain daily activities on their own, such dressing and bathing themselves.\n\nHow resveratrol may be affecting the Alzheimer\u2019s disease process isn\u2019t clear yet.\n\nTurner says the findings don\u2019t suggest that red wine is a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s. The amounts of resveratrol in the purified doses that the participants took were extremely high and beyond those found on the market currently \u2014 around what would be contained in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.\n\nPlus, he says, resveratrol supplements currently available over the counter are \u201cunregulated and we don\u2019t know how much is in it. We need more studies to see if it really does have benefit and then it could be turned into more effective drugs that can better target Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d\n\n5 Horrible Habits You Need to Stop Right Now Chris Pecoraro\u2014Getty Images Sam Edwards\u2014Getty Images/Caiaimage Jetta Productions\u2014Getty Images by nacoki ( MEDIA ARC )\u2014Getty Images/Flickr RF Reza Estakhrian\u2014Getty Images 1 of 5 Advertisement\n\nCorrection: The original version of this story misstated that all the participants were men.
