Foods and fruits high in these antioxidants have been dubbed as \"super foods\" or \"super fruits\" by the media.\n\n\"These substances help keep the arteries healthy and are protective against cardiovascular disease,\" says preventive cardiologist Suzanne Steinbaum, MD, of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, in an email. \"When looking for a sweet snack, a square of dark chocolate might, in fact, be your healthiest choice!\"\n\nCocoa or cacao beans are not beans but the seeds of the fruit of the Theobroma cacao tree. The seeds are dried and then processed to produce cocoa powder. Dark chocolate generally has a higher percentage of cocoa content than milk chocolate.", "images":
