It will also disproportionately affect younger people by tripling the number of men under 45 and doubling the number of women under 45 with the diagnosis.\n\nAmerican Heart Association\n\nThe new guidelines reflect years of research, which have shown that people within the new range of blood pressure defined as hypertension have doubled their risk of cardiovascular problems in the future, such as heart attacks or strokes. As such, health care professionals should be identifying these patients and helping to initiate interventions to bring down blood pressure.\n\nWhile the new guidelines significantly increase the number of Americans with a diagnosis of hypertension, they do not suggest a proportionate increase in treating with medication. The number of Americans with hypertension who are recommended for medical treatment would increase by only 4.2 million adults, or 5 percent more than were previously recommended. Medication will be recommended for patients with previous cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, or significant cardiovascular risk factors determined by factors such as age, blood tests and having other medical conditions that increase risk of heart attack.\n\nThe study authors recommend lifestyle changes, including exercise, diet modifications and weight loss, as the first step to reducing high blood pressure.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDoctors in the guidelines stress the importance of using two separate blood pressure readings on two different occasions to diagnose hypertension. They recommend that those with hypertension use approved blood pressure monitors at home. Writing down these readings at home can help tell the difference between people with truly abnormal blood pressure and those with \u201cwhite-coat syndrome\u201d -- with high blood pressure only under stress like at the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nHigh blood pressure increases the risk of cardiac problems and strokes, and is sometimes called \u201cthe silent killer\u201d because so many adults live with high blood pressure and don\u2019t know it.\n\nTo help understand the new hypertension guidelines and how they affect managing your health, see your healthcare professional.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/high-blodd-pressure-gty-hb-171113_12x5_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/blood-pressure-gty-hb-171113_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/blood-pressure-graphic-ht-hb-171113_21x11_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/high-blodd-pressure-gty-hb-171113_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/high-blodd-pressure-gty-hb-171113_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Ted Handler Md"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/103-million-americans-high-blood-pressure-guidelines/story?id=51121618", "title": "More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines by the American Heart Association.", "keywords": "abcnews,health news, medical news, medical articles", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2017-11-14T06:34:28:340-08", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines", "description": "More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines by the American Heart Association.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/103-million-americans-high-blood-pressure-guidelines/story?id=51121618", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/high-blodd-pressure-gty-hb-171113_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "abcnews", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines", "description": "More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines by the American Heart Association.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/103-million-americans-high-blood-pressure-guidelines/story?id=51121618", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/high-blodd-pressure-gty-hb-171113_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,51121618", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,51121618", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/103-million-americans-high-blood-pressure-guidelines/story?id=51121618"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,51121618", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,51121618", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/103-million-americans-high-blood-pressure-guidelines/story?id=51121618", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/103-million-americans-high-blood-pressure-guidelines/story?id=51121618"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
