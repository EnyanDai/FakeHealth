Last week, a review of prior studies suggested that selenium probably doesn\u2019t help prevent cancer, but might be linked to an increased diabetes risk at high doses (see Reuters Health story of May 11, 2011.)\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know where we are,\u201d Guallar told Reuters Health. \u201cIn a sense it\u2019s a necessary micronutrient and we need it, but we might be (in) a situation where we have enough \u2014 we might even have too much.\u201d\n\nSelenium is found in meat, bread, and some nuts. It\u2019s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month\u2019s supply.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine recommends U.S. adults consume 55 micrograms of selenium per day.\n\nGuallar and his colleagues wanted to look specifically at the link between selenium and cholesterol. They recruited about 500 older adults in the UK to take one of three different doses of selenium daily \u2014 100, 200, or 300 micrograms \u2014 or a placebo pill with no selenium.\n\nResearchers measured participants\u2019 cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study and after six months on the selenium supplements or placebo. Their results are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nParticipants had an average starting cholesterol of about 230 milligrams per deciliter of blood. A healthy cholesterol level is less than 200 mg/dL, according to the American Heart Association, while 200 to 239 mg/dL is considered \u201cborderline high.\u201d\n\nIn the groups taking 100 and 200 micrograms of selenium daily, total cholesterol dropped an average of 8.5 mg/dL and 9.7 mg/dL, respectively, compared to the group taking a placebo pill.\n\nTaking the highest dose of selenium was not linked to decreases in total cholesterol \u2014 but it was the only dose associated with an increase in HDL (\u201cgood\u201d) cholesterol.\n\nThe authors reported no serious side effects associated with selenium during the study.\n\nWhile Guallar said the results are \u201cgood news\u201d in showing that high selenium intake is probably not a risk for high cholesterol, he wanted to add a note of caution.\n\nThe finding \u201cis not generalizable to other patients,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a population like the U.S. where selenium levels are adequate, there\u2019s no reason to take extra selenium in supplements.\u201d\n\nThe question of the link between selenium and health outcomes, Guallar said, \u201cis a very interesting story that\u2019s still developing.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/atTzv0 Annals of Internal Medicine, online May 16, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Genevra Pittman", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-selenium-cholesterol-idUSTRE74F80M20110516", "title": "Can selenium lower cholesterol?", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
