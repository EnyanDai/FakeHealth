It\u2019s a new day for lung cancer treatment,\u201d Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne\u2019s University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented.\n\nAn editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become \u201ca new standard of care\u201d.\n\nThe various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected.\n\nRival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1.\n\nKeytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy.\n\nLead researcher Martin Reck of Germany\u2019s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard \u201cfrom today\u201d.\n\nU.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24.\n\nMerck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO.\n\nCOMBINATION THERAPY\n\nThe second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study.\n\nMany experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors\u2019 expectations, up until now, have been quite low.\n\nIn the event, researchers reported that Merck\u2019s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent.\n\nPatients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response.\n\nRoger Perlmutter, Merck\u2019s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old.\n\nDrugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body\u2019s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.\n\nThey are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market.\n\nUp until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen.\n\nThe current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nResults of Bristol\u2019s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.\n\nThese showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months.\n\nThe failure of Opdivo to work for \u201call comers\u201d in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company\u2019s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.\n\nMany now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ben Hirschler", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-merck-co-idUSKCN12904Q", "title": "'New day' in lung cancer as Merck drug shines, works with chemo", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "medical-research;conquering-cancer;companies-mrch;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy.", "Author": "Ben Hirschler", "keywords": "Germany,United States,Martin Reck,Roger M.
