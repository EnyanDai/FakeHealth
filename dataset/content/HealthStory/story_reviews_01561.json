Zipes, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, said the new device could someday displace existing models used in many patients Every month, about 10,000 patients in this country get a defibrillator, either for the first time or as replacements for devices whose batteries have worn out.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn recent years, the safety of defibrillator wires has come in particular focus because a model made by Medtronic has been prone to fracturing. Hundreds of patients who received the model have had to undergo new operations to replace it. Also, scar tissue often builds up around intravenous wires, a process that can make removing and replacing them difficult or dangerous.\n\nDr. Bardy said in a telephone interview that the deaths of several patients many years ago because of wire-related injuries were a factor in his interest in developing the new device.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at a therapy that can avert, we hope, complications and be as effective,\u201d he said.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Since the cardiologist began work on the project about a decade ago, the defibrillator he helped design has gone through several iterations.\n\nThe device will not be suitable for a significant number of heart patients, particularly those who require units that also include a pacemaker, which regulates a heart that is beating too fast or too slowly.\n\nBut Dr. Bardy estimated that the device could work in about 25 percent of patients who now get a defibrillator. These are largely patients at risk, because of genetic factors or certain types of heart diseases, for a type of erratic cardiac rhythm that can cause sudden death. Dr. Bardy said the cost of the new device is about the same as a standard defibrillator. However, he said it could help reduce health care costs, because implanting it is much simpler.\n\nBefore the device can be sold here, Cameron Health will have to submit more extensive human trial data to the F.D.A.. Dr. Bardy said a larger study of the device has just begun in this country and overseas and that it will most likely take a year or more to assemble data from it for the agency\u2019s review.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/business/13device_CA0/13device_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/12/business/8618_1_device_75x75.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/business/13device_CA0/13device_CA0-popup.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/business/13device_CA0/13device_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Barry Meier"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/13device.html", "title": "Less Invasive Heart Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1247467831081", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/13device.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/13device.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1247467831081"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/13device.html", "title": "Less Invasive Heart Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality", "description": "A new device delivers a jolt through a sensor implanted under a patient\u2019s skin, but not wired to a patient\u2019s heart.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Less Invasive Heart Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality", "description": "A new device delivers a jolt through a sensor implanted under a patient\u2019s skin, but not wired to a patient\u2019s heart.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1247467831081, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Less Invasive Heart Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality", "pdate": 20100512, "utime": 20150209111409, "ptime": 20100512150113, "DISPLAYDATE": "May 12, 2010", "dat": "May 12, 2010", "lp": "A new device delivers a jolt through a sensor implanted under a patient\u2019s skin, but not wired to a patient\u2019s heart.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "13device", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-05-12T15:01:13-04:00", "modified": "2015-02-09T11:14:09-05:00", "section": "Business Day", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "top-level-section": "business", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/barry-meier", "tag": "Medicine and Health"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/13device.html", "type": "article", "title": "Less Invasive Heart Defibrillators Seen Closer to Reality", "description": "A new device delivers a jolt through a sensor implanted under a patient\u2019s skin, but not wired to a patient\u2019s heart.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/business/13device_CA0/13device_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Barry Meier", "tone": "news", "byl": "By BARRY MEIER", "PT": "article", "CG": "business", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Medicine and Health", "keywords": "Defibrillators,Medical Devices,Implants,Medicine and Health", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/13/business/13device_CA0/13device_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1273723200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
