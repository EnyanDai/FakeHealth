Patients are prone to infections and progressively lose the ability to breathe.\n\nUntil Tuesday's approval of Kalydeco, the 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients in the U.S. and 100,000 world-wide could take medicines that only tackled the symptoms of the disease, such as antibiotics to treat the infections. Patients typically spent a few hours each day wearing vibrating vests to dislodge mucus build-up.\n\nThe medicine is a pill meant to be taken twice daily with fat-containing food. It was approved to treat patients who have a mutation in a gene that causes cystic fibrosis in about 4% of CF patients, some 1,200 people in the U.S.\n\nThe mutation, called G551D, is in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The CFTR gene regulates the transport of chloride and water in the body. Kalydeco helps the protein made by the CFTR gene function better, which improves lung function and improves other side effects of cystic fibrosis.\n\n\"Now I'm nervous about growing old,\" said Emily Schaller, a 29-year-old from Trenton, Mich., who has been taking the pills as part of clinical trials since late 2009 and has since run five half-marathons. \"I've never been more hopeful.\"\n\nKalydeco comes with one of the most expensive price tags for a medicine, according to Lawrence Marsh, a Barclays Capital analyst. He said more expensive drugs include Soliris, which treats a blood disorder and costs $409,500 a year, and Elaprase, which treats a potentially fatal condition that causes mental retardation and costs $375,000 a year.\n\nLike Kalydeco, these drugs tend to provide significant improvements for a small number of patients. For that reason, health plans tend to cover the cost.\n\nJeff Leiden, who becomes Vertex's chief executive on Wednesday, said the pricing reflects the value the drug provides, the small number of patients indicated for it, and the company's hefty investment in developing cystic fibrosis treatments.\n\nIt is \"hard to make these drugs. It takes hundreds of people working over a number of years and hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's all at risk\" of not succeeding, Dr. Leiden said in an interview.\n\nVertex plans to provide some financial assistance to patients. After $15 a month, for instance, it will pay up to 30% of the drug's cost\u2014as much as $88,000 a year\u2014for eligible patients who are commercially insured but facing high co-pays or co-insurance costs, a spokesman said. The company will also assign a case manager to each patient to help guide them through financial issues.\n\nKalydeco was approved for use in patients six-years-old and older. It was approved in about three months and ahead of an April deadline, according to FDA and the company. The company is planning a study of the drug in patients between two years and five years old.\n\nWrite to Jonathan D.
