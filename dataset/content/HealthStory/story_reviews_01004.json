Those who drank between one-third and 1 drink per day five to seven days a week were almost 50 percent more likely to be in good health when they got older compared with those who did not imbibe.\n\nThat was after accounting for other factors, such as smoking. Good overall health was defined as having no major chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, as well as having no significant decline in their thinking or physical abilities.\n\n\u201cThese data suggest that regular, moderate consumption of alcohol at midlife may be related to a modest increase in overall health status among women who survive to older ages,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nNow, the researchers stressed that wasn\u2019t the case for women who consumed more than two drinks a day or four drinks or more at a time.\n\nThe findings fit with current federal dietary guidelines, which recommend up to one drink per day for women and just to two drinks per day for men.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/sRNPXEGxw8O_DGFXDdt4z2LD_0s=/480x0/www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/files/2017/01/Trump-Revealed.paperback.jpg", "http://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rob Stein", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-checkup/post/a-drink-a-day-good-for-middle-aged-women-study-finds/2011/09/01/gIQAteGs6J_blog.html", "title": "A drink a day good for middle-aged women, study finds", "meta_data": {"eomportal-uuid": "113e7cc6-d4b6-11e0-933b-9b41af1867a6", "object-hash": 1573358457, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": "alcohol, alcoholic beverage, drinking, harvard school of public health, drinking good for middle-aged women, women's health", "news_keywords": "alcohol, alcoholic beverage, drinking, harvard school of public health, drinking good for middle-aged women, women's health", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-checkup/post/a-drink-a-day-good-for-middle-aged-women-study-finds/2011/09/01/gIQAteGs6J_blog.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "title": "A drink a day good for middle-aged women, study finds", "description": "For women who like a nice glass of wine at the end of the day, there\u2019s more good news: Even middle-aged women can benefit from a drink a day, according to new research."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "description": "For women who like a nice glass of wine at the end of the day, there\u2019s more good news: Even middle-aged women can benefit from a drink a day, according to new research.", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1314849600.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
