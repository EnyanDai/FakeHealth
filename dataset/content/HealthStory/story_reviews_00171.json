The product, called Hello, Peanut, can be mixed into pur\u00e9ed baby food to expose infants to peanuts starting around five months old.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration allowed the new item, developed by a physician, to make the claim just months after the nation\u2019s top allergy experts reversed longstanding advice on preventing peanut allergies, dropping recommendations to withhold all peanut-containing foods in early childhood in favor of early, frequent exposure, starting with peanut powder or extract for infants beginning to eat solid food. The label warns that evidence is limited.\n\nWhile many foods like whole grains, nuts and supplements carry qualified health claims stating that they may reduce the risk of diseases like cancer or heart disease, this is the first time a food product label will be allowed to make a qualified claim that it reduces the risk of an allergy, officials said. A qualified claim means there is evidence supporting the claim, but it is not conclusive.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important claim for us to allow to be incorporated into food labels,\u201d said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the F.D.A. \u201cThe guidelines for how to approach allergens in children are changing, the science is changing, and it\u2019s important for parents to know.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/well/family/well-family-peanut2/well-family-peanut2-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/well/family/well-family-peanut2/well-family-peanut2-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/well/family/well-family-peanut2/well-family-peanut2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roni Caryn Rabin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/well/family/new-product-is-first-to-claim-it-may-reduce-peanut-allergies.html", "title": "New Product Is First to Claim It May Reduce Peanut Allergies", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-09-14T20:18:23.000Z", "modified": "2017-09-15T15:02:04.000Z", "section": "Well", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/roni-caryn-rabin", "tag": "Food and Drug Administration", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005431061, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/724ea225-d75f-5020-9d49-7e56006a39c1", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/513f6dd632d9405d9ce5483c941e1e0e", "description": "The label of a new powdered peanut product is the first to be allowed to claim it may reduce peanut allergies in susceptible infants.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/well/family/well-family-peanut2/well-family-peanut2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Roni Caryn Rabin", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/well/family/well-family-peanut2/well-family-peanut2-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Peanut,Allergy,Baby food,Babies,Product Labels,Peanut butter,Anaphylaxis,FDA", "pdate": 20170914, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/well/family/new-product-is-first-to-claim-it-may-reduce-peanut-allergies.html", "type": "article", "title": "New Product Is First to Claim It May Reduce Peanut Allergies", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/well/family/well-family-peanut2/well-family-peanut2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Hello, Peanut is the first product the Food and Drug Administration has allowed to carry a label saying it may reduce peanut allergies in susceptible infants."}, "description": "The label of a new powdered peanut product is the first to be allowed to claim it may reduce peanut allergies in susceptible infants."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/well/family/new-product-is-first-to-claim-it-may-reduce-peanut-allergies.html", "title": "New Product Is First to Claim It May Reduce Peanut Allergies", "description": "The label of a new powdered peanut product is the first to be allowed to claim it may reduce peanut allergies in susceptible infants.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/well/family/well-family-peanut2/well-family-peanut2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Hello, Peanut is the first product the Food and Drug Administration has allowed to carry a label saying it may reduce peanut allergies in susceptible infants."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005431061"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "well", "SCG": "family", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/well/family/new-product-is-first-to-claim-it-may-reduce-peanut-allergies.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005431061", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/well/family/new-product-is-first-to-claim-it-may-reduce-peanut-allergies.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/well/family/new-product-is-first-to-claim-it-may-reduce-peanut-allergies.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505361600.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
