He worries that sometimes psychiatrists \u201cmay think we are better than we really are\u201d at making these choices.\n\nMcLean Hospital psychiatrists Brent Forester, left, and Ipsit Vahia, are occasionally using genomics to help inform decisions about prescribing anti-depressants.

Other branches of medicine, such as oncology, have embraced gene-based testing to help determine which cancer patients need chemotherapy or surgery. But psychiatrists typically haven\u2019t let genomics guide treatment decisions, Dr. Forester says.\n\nOne test, called GeneSight, uses a genetic analysis of DNA samples from a cheek swab to help doctors figure out which drugs are likely to combat a patient\u2019s depression. The test examines a dozen genes to determine how well the patient will metabolize certain drugs and how his or her brain will respond to them.\n\nSupplies and paperwork for a GeneSight test, which analyzes DNA samples from a cheek swab to help determine which drugs are likely to combat depression.

Based on a patient\u2019s results, drugs are categorized as ones to be avoided, ones that have some drawbacks and ones that can be used \u201cas directed.\u201d\n\nBarbara Dellovade, a retired real estate broker in Acton, Mass., became depressed last year. Ms. Dellovade, who is 78 years old, was taking an anti-depressant, but \u201cI wasn\u2019t reacting well to it and it wasn\u2019t helping me at all.\u201d She consulted Ipsit Vahia, a geriatric psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nMore The Food That Helps Battle Depression\n\nDr. Vahia told Ms. Dellovade about the genomics test, which retails for $1,500 and is covered by Medicare and some health plans. After receiving an analysis of Ms. Dellovade\u2019s results, he switched her to a different anti-depressant and she began to respond in about six weeks, he says. Ms. Dellovade has been feeling better, she says, though \u201cI am still not there.\u201d\n\nDr. Vahia has been using the gene test more with his older depressed patients but says clinical judgment remains paramount in prescribing. \u201cThe brain...is the most complex organ in the body,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a small step, but it is an important step. We are adding a degree of precision\u201d to treating depression.\n\nMcLean Hospital is one of 60 sites across the country that took part in a randomized trial of GeneSight. The results, which will be unveiled this week at the American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed that patients fared better when physicians chose a medication with the help of the test, rather than relying solely on their judgment.\n\nAmong the 1,167 patients in the trial, half took the GeneSight test and half were prescribed drugs based purely on their doctors\u2019 clinical assessments. Genetics helps you \u201cmarry\u201d a patient with the appropriate medication, says Bryan Dechairo, executive vice president for clinical development at Myriad Genetics, which funded the trial. Assurex Health, a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, developed the GeneSight test.\n\nThe results were striking, according to doctors at several medical centers who participated in the trial. Patients were more likely to respond to anti-depressants when the gene test was used to determine which drug they should be on; researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied. Every patient in the trial had been on at least one anti-depressant that failed to work, and some had been on several that failed.\n\nJohn Greden, the principal investigator in the GeneSight trial, is a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Comprehensive Depression Center.

Dr. Greden, a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan\u2019s Comprehensive Depression Center, says that until now, many doctors took the following approach: \u201cMy favorite anti-depressant is this one, so I will try it. Oh, that didn\u2019t work, so I will try this one.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, he says, under that hit-or-miss method\u2014albeit informed by training and experience\u2014\u201cfewer than 40% of patients achieve remission.\u201d Every year, 16 million Americans suffer an episode of depression, he says, making pinpointed diagnoses essential.\n\nSome doctors took a while to come around to the GeneSight test. Charles DeBattista, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, says initially he was \u201csomewhat skeptical.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior to the study I used it very rarely,\u201d says Dr. DeBattista, who specializes in patients with treatment-resistant depression. He has been using the test more on patients who \u201chave had problems tolerating medicine in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is nothing magical about it; it is not a substitute for clinical judgment.\u201d But it does inform him what drug to try on a patient with serious depression.\n\nHis Stanford colleague Alan Schatzberg isn\u2019t persuaded. The test \u201chas some value,\u201d says Dr. Schatzberg, a psychiatrist and a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. \u201cIt has some use but what it doesn\u2019t do is tell you which specific drug to use.\u201d He adds, \u201cWhat the field really wants is a test that tells me which specific drug I should put my patient on.\u201d\n\nThat is precisely what Charles Conway, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, likes about it. The test \u201cprovides recommendations,\u201d Dr. Conway says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say: \u2018Give this drug only.\u2019 It says: \u2018You have a range of choices, which you will [make] based on your clinical judgment.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-AH725_PERSRX_P_20180504135453.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/9c9718d16130fb9290ab02a73d3b5dd8c412d97a.jpg?5dc95278", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/2a7d0786567f18bb6a72f17019cd642c0b51f730.jpg?5dc9a61e", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-AH726_PERSRX_P_20180504135726.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125024/social", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/93d4c0693749e5d6abc5f87d798d3bfdb580948b.jpg?5dc995fd", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746?width=111&height=62", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/0d2ffa0d6fff89f02d5a9d5508d5467ad9dbd858.jpg?5dc99f52", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/869c2a340c4c25db5466a6de556da60ae1a2bf4e.jpg?5dc9a205", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125154?width=111&height=62", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/f600b0a56ee84a4d350fa4e522e51ee27d5fd426.jpg?5dc9a19d", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-AH659_PERSRX_P_20180504112420.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/b5e977a5139ed9e9684742f90919df7b635ae623.jpg?5dc94a1a", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-AH659_PERSRX_D_20180504112420.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-AH724_PERSRX_FR_20180504135247.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-AH659_PERSRX_SOC_20180504112420.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/4a581253a775cca47f02b15ba756a5f4ccf7b8bf.jpg?5dc969b8", "https://images.wsj.net/im-124802?width=111&height=62", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/461b35da8a2936ee4a7ca01072773c0d5aa427f2.jpg?5dc9a214"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-AH659_PERSRX_SOC_20180504112420.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucette Lagnado"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/which-anti-depressant-is-right-for-you-your-dna-can-shed-some-light-1525622524", "title": "Which Anti-Depressant Is Right for You?
