They all had greater antibacterial effect after five minutes compared to lab specimens exposed to plain alcohol, but thyme was the most potent.\n\nIn fact, the thyme tincture was more powerful than standard concentrations of benzoyl peroxide, which is the active ingredient in many acne products. The new findings were presented at the Society for General Microbiology's Spring Conference in Dublin.\n\n\"If thyme tincture is proven to be as clinically effective as our findings suggest, it may be a natural alternative to current treatments,\" researcher Margarita Gomez-Escalada, PhD, says in a news release. \"The problem with treatments containing benzoyl peroxide is the side effects they are associated with,\" namely a burning sensation and skin irritation.\n\n\"Herbal preparations are less harsh on the skin due to their anti-inflammatory properties, while our results suggest they can be just as, if not more, effective than chemical treatments,\" she says.\n\nBut some U.S. dermatologists are quick to caution that while intriguing, this research is still preliminary, and thyme-tinged acne treatments are not yet ready for prime time.", "images":
