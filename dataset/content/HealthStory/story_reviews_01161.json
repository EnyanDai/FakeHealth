{"url": "http://www.WebMD.com/diet/weight-loss-surgery/news/20110321/study-poor-results-from-lap-band-surgery", "text": "March 21, 2011 -- Long-term results for Lap-Band weight loss surgery are relatively poor, according to a new study from Belgium.\n\nBut a spokesman for the company that manufactures Lap-Band says the study is flawed.\n\nNearly half of the 82 patients followed for 12 years or longer required removal of the bands and about 40% had major complications, the researchers found. The average weight loss was below what experts consider good results. Even so, a majority of the patients in their small study said they were satisfied with the procedure.\n\nDespite that degree of satisfaction, \"I think people have exaggerated expectations from the band procedure,\" says researcher Jacques Himpens, MD, an attending surgeon at St. Pierre University Hospital in Brussels. His study findings, he tells WebMD, are ''a reality call.\"\n\nBut some, including the manufacturer of the Lap-Band -- used in a technique called laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding -- take exception to the study, criticizing the small sample size and the number of patients lost to follow-up.\n\nThe critics also point out that both the device itself and the expertise of surgeons placing it have improved greatly since the patients in the study had their bands placed, in the years 1994 through 1997.\n\nBut Himpens tells WebMD he's skeptical either would make much difference. \"My impression is, even with the newer band, the results are not significantly better,\" he says.\n\nHe emphasizes he is not against the use of gastric band surgery, but that based on his study results, patients who opt for the procedure should know there's a good chance they will need a follow-up procedure and they may have less weight loss and more complications than those who choose other weight loss surgeries.", "images":
