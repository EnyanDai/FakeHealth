The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.\n\nThey focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.\n\n\u201cThe entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain\u2019s memory mainframe,\u201d Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain\u2019s chief memory center.\n\nFor the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.\n\n\u201cWhen we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,\u201d Fried said.\n\nCompared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.\n\nIMPACT ON ALZHEIMER\u2019S\n\nIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.\n\nFried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.\n\n\u201cThe question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,\u201d he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.\n\nDespite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer\u2019s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.\n\nSuzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was \u201cvery excited about the finding,\u201d but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\n\nThe Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nOne team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer\u2019s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.\n\nDr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer\u2019s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.\n\n\u201cAlthough the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,\u201d Black wrote.", "images":
