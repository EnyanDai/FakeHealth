The downside, some physicians say, is that it costs more and delivers twice as much radiation as traditional mammograms.\n\nTomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography, has been available in the U.S. since February from Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass. In just a few months, radiologists say they are finding cancers they would have missed with the standard exam.\n\nOthers, though, urge caution. \"We really have to wait for the scientific evidence,\" says Barbara Monsees, who heads the American College of Radiology's breast-imaging commission, adding that the technology looks \"promising.\"\n\nMany digital mammogram centers are increasingly offering the option of paying a supplement out of pocket for a 3-D image. Standard mammograms miss 5% to 15% of tumors, in part because small ones can be hidden behind tissue. We discuss with Robert Cascella, CEO of Hologic, which manufactures a 3-D mammography machine.

Preliminary results, presented at a scientific meeting in November, showed a 47% increase in cancer detection, but no conclusion can be drawn until the full results are published in a peer-reviewed journal, says Dr. Monsees.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends women get annual mammograms starting at 40 years old. A 3-D mammography machine is similar those used for standard 2-D mammography, but instead of taking just top and side pictures of each breast, the X-ray arm of a 3-D machine moves in an arc and collects detailed data used to create 50 or 60 razor-thin slices for each view. The 3-D scans show what breast tissue looks like at various depths.\n\nRadiologists say they can now see tumors that would have been obscured by surrounding tissue. \"I think we're going to find more cancers at an earlier stage\" says Liane Philpotts, chief of breast imaging at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., adding that one recent tumor, difficult to see on a standard exam, \"jumped right out at us\" on a 3-D scan.\n\nThe benefit is particularly noticeable in women with dense breasts, in which tumors can be hard to see, but the 3-D exam produces better results in all women, she says.\n\nThe new exam will likely save lives by finding cancers earlier and give women \"more options,\" such as skipping chemotherapy or getting a lighter dose, says Laurie Margolies, director of Breast Imaging at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Dr. Margolies has briefly consulted for Hologic but has no continuing relationship with the company.\n\nIn addition to finding more tumors, early experience shows the 3-D exam may reduce anxiety-producing \"recalls,\" in which women are told to return for a diagnostic work-up after the mammogram looks unclear or concerning; recalls are mostly false alarms. In a 7,529-woman study at Yale University, the recall rate of women screened with 3-D and 2-D mammography combined was 6.6%, compared with 11.1% for 2-D alone.\n\nThe full exam typically includes a standard 2-D view as well as a 3-D one and has a patient under compression for a total of about 48 seconds, compared with 20 for a standard exam, Hologic says. Insurance often doesn't cover the 3-D portion so doctors say you often need to pay about $50 out of pocket. (The 2-D exam is done in part to aid in comparing results with earlier scans, Hologic says.)\n\nThe combination exam delivers 8.8 milligray of radiation per exam, around double what is given during a standard exam on Hologic 2-D machines, the company says. The double radiation dose could potentially cause cancer in 1 in 1,000 women who get 3-D mammography annually from age 40 until 80 instead of the standard exam, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe more-detailed exam will save lives overall over the 2-D scan if at least 3% more cancers are detected, which appears likely from preliminary data, says Peter Soltani, senior vice president of breast health at Hologic. He adds that small amounts of radiation from mammography have never been proven to cause cancer.\n\nHologic has applied to the FDA for approval to market a technology that would synthesize a 2-D image from detail taken in the 3-D sweep and which physicians say would significantly lower the radiation because you'd only have to take one set of images instead of two. General Electric Co. is also applying to the FDA for permission to market a 3-D mammography machine; the company declined to say when it expects a decision.\n\n\u2014Email aches@wsj.com", "images": ["https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/fddd6d28f0576a5772474e644a95623747e1cb4b.jpg?5dc9ac40", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/b5e977a5139ed9e9684742f90919df7b635ae623.jpg?5dc9aba2", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BJ959_ACHES_P_20121001174700.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/0d2ffa0d6fff89f02d5a9d5508d5467ad9dbd858.jpg?5dc9aba1", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BJ959_ACHES_G_20121001174700.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/487b80633438bb2d561829c2e7f8bccee2c45e0b.jpg?5dc9ab9e", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/93d4c0693749e5d6abc5f87d798d3bfdb580948b.jpg?5dc995fd", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746?width=111&height=62", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/f600b0a56ee84a4d350fa4e522e51ee27d5fd426.jpg?5dc9aba3", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125154?width=111&height=62", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BJ959_ACHES_D_20121001174700.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/461b35da8a2936ee4a7ca01072773c0d5aa427f2.jpg?5dc9aba4", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/2a7d0786567f18bb6a72f17019cd642c0b51f730.jpg?5dc9b0a0", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/869c2a340c4c25db5466a6de556da60ae1a2bf4e.jpg?5dc9aba2", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/4a581253a775cca47f02b15ba756a5f4ccf7b8bf.jpg?5dc969b8", "https://images.wsj.net/im-124802?width=111&height=62", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BJ959_ACHES_G_20121001174700.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Johannes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444712904578024932844225310", "title": "Is a 3-D Mammogram Better at Avoiding False Positives?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dj.asn": "i-0a58", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "page.section": "Article", "page.content.type": "Article", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online", "article.template": "full", "page.site": "wsj", "page.site.product": "WSJ", "page.region": "na,us", "article.id": "SB10000872396390444712904578024932844225310", "article.type": "Aches & Claims", "article.type.display": "Aches & Claims", "article.access": "free", "article.headline": "Is a 3-D Mammogram Better at Avoiding False Positives?", "article.summary": "Tomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography, has been available in the U.S. since February.
