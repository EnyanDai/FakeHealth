These high and low phases are often so extreme they interfere with everyday life and work.\n\nIn a telephone interview Churchill said that in tests, his team found that mice who were made manic with small doses of amphetamines were able to be calmed again with ebselen.\n\n\u201cIn mice, ebselen works like lithium,\u201d Churchill said. \u201cNow we urgently need to see if it works like lithium in people.\u201d\n\nSome 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium - a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide - remains the most effective long-term treatment.\n\nBut it is very toxic - at only twice the right dose it could kill a patient, Churchill said - and its adverse side-effects mean many people stop taking the drug and relapse into episodes of mania and depression.\n\nChurchill worked with Sridhar Vasudevan to filter through a library of existing drugs - the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection - that are considered safe but do not currently have a proven use.\n\nThey screened the library for any drugs that blocked an enzyme that is key to lithium\u2019s success and found ebselen was a possible lithium mimic.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the first handful of examples of drug repurposing, where a new use has been found for an existing drug,\u201d Vasudevan said.\n\nEbselen is an antioxidant originally developed up to late stage, or phase III, clinical trials by the Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo for the treatment of stroke, but which never reached market and is now out of patent.\n\nVasudevan said his study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, showed ebselen had the same or similar action as lithium in the brains of mice, blocking the same enzyme.\n\nThe researchers are a now starting a small study in healthy human volunteers to look for effects on brain function. If that shows ebselen has similar effects to lithium, they plan to move to second stage trial in bipolar patients.
