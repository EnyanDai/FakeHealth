At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result,\u201d said Graham Cooke, who co-led the research from the Imperial\u2019s department of medicine.\n\n\u201cWe have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip.\u201d\n\nThe test, which uses a mobile phone chip, requires a drop of blood to be placed onto a spot on the USB stick. Any HIV in the sample triggers an acidity change, which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. This is sent to the USB stick, which shows the result on a computer or electronic device.\n\nPublished in the journal Scientific Reports, results showed the stick test was 95 percent accurate over 991 blood samples, and the average time to produce a reading was 20.8 minutes.\n\nSome 36 million people worldwide are infected with the human deficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, and the majority of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nCurrent AIDS drugs, called anti-retrovirals, reduce virus levels in a patients blood to near zero.\n\nBut in some cases the drugs stop working - sometimes because virus has developed resistance to them - and the first sign of that would be a rise in a patient\u2019s so-called \u201cviral load\u201d.\n\nVirus levels can\u2019t be detected by routine HIV tests, which can only show whether or not a person has the virus.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hiv-usb-idUSKBN13511L", "title": "Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;africa-news;consolidated-business", "description": "Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient's blood.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "United States,Graham Cooke,US,HEALTH,HIV,USB,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Africa,Corporate Events,Life Sciences,World Health Organization,Government Borrowing Requirement,AIDS / HIV,Europe,Science,Drug and Device Development,Healthcare (TRBC),Technology Equipment (TRBC),United Kingdom", "news_keywords": "United States;Graham Cooke;US;HEALTH;HIV;USB;Health / Medicine;Western Europe;Africa;Corporate Events;Life Sciences;World Health Organization;Government Borrowing Requirement;AIDS / HIV;Europe;Science;Drug and Device Development;Healthcare (TRBC);Technology Equipment (TRBC);United Kingdom", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Nov 10 10:05:16 UTC 2016", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2016-11-10T10:05:16+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hiv-usb-idUSKBN13511L", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Graham Cooke,US,HEALTH,HIV,USB,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Africa,Corporate Events,Life Sciences,World Health Organization,Government Borrowing Requirement,AIDS / HIV,Europe,Science,Drug and Device Development,Healthcare (TRBC),Technology Equipment (TRBC),United Kingdom", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEALTH-HIV-USB", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2016-11-10T10:05:16+0000", "sailthru.title": "Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hiv-usb-idUSKBN13511L", "type": "article", "description": "Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that c...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-11-10T10:05:16+0000", "modified_time": "2016-11-10T10:05:16+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "United States,Graham Cooke,US,HEALTH,HIV,USB,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Africa,Corporate Events,Life Sciences,World Health Organization,Government Borrowing Requirement,AIDS / HIV,Europe,Science,Drug and Device Development,Healthcare (TRBC),Technology Equipment (TRBC),United Kingdom"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Scientists develop new type of HIV test on a USB stick", "description": "Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient's blood.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
