{"url": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/10/gonorrhea-vaccine-study/", "text": "Finally, the world might be catching a break when it comes to drug-resistant gonorrhea.\n\nA new study suggests that a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also ward off the sexually transmitted infection.\n\nThe research, conducted in New Zealand, found that the gonorrhea rate among teens and young adults there who had received a meningitis B vaccine during an emergency campaign in the early 2000s was significantly lower than the rate seen in people of the same age who weren\u2019t vaccinated.\n\nadvertisement\n\nResearchers in Quebec say they saw the same phenomenon after a meningitis outbreak there, and previously published data from Cuba and Norway also hint of the vaccine\u2019s unexpected benefit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite probably real,\u201d said Helen Petousis-Harris, lead author of the New Zealand article and head of immunization research and vaccinology at the University of Auckland.\n\nThe findings are observational. Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.\n\nThe last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.\n\n\u201cWhile it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,\u201d said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.\n\nWhy would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.\n\nMeningitis is a condition \u2014 inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord \u2014 that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.\n\nOne of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.\n\nDespite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.\n\nMeningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for The Readout Your daily guide to what\u2019s happening in biotech.

As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.\n\nThat may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.\n\n\u201cA lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,\u201d Petousis-Harris said. \u201cAnd what\u2019s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.\n\nPetousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn\u2019t received the meningococcal B vaccine.\n\nThe study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.\n\nThe single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.\n\nDr. Jean Longtin, head of the province\u2019s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.\n\n\u201cIn Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,\u201d said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. \u201cGonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it\u2019s following the rest of the province.\u201d\n\nIt is not clear how long the protection \u2014 if it\u2019s real \u2014 will actually last. But even a few years of protection could help significantly reduce the spread of gonorrhea, experts argue.\n\n\u201cMathematical modeling has shown that even a vaccine of moderate efficacy and duration could have a substantial effect on the transmission and prevalence of gonorrhea, if coverage in the population is high and protection lasts during the highest risk period,\u201d Kate Seib, of Australia\u2019s Institute for Glycomics, wrote in a commentary that accompanied the study.", "images": ["https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsletter-Logo-Images-DR.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/stat-logo.svg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/plugins/stat-lazy-load/images/330x400-00000000.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gonorrhea_PHIL_2649-645x645.jpg", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=46858&fmt=gif", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gonorrhea_PHIL_2649-1024x576.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Circular_Helen.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=436331036555416&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gonorrhea_PHIL_2649-1024x576.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Helen Branswell", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Sharon Begley", "Megan Thielking", "Elizabeth Preston", "Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/10/gonorrhea-vaccine-study/", "title": "Vaccine shows protection against gonorrhea for first time, study says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "origin", "description": "A new study suggests that a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also ward off the sexually transmitted infection.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccine shows protection against gonorrhea for first time, study says", "description": "A new study suggests that a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also ward off the sexually transmitted infection.", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/10/gonorrhea-vaccine-study/", "site_name": "STAT", "updated_time": "2017-07-10T21:01:56+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gonorrhea_PHIL_2649-1024x576.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gonorrhea_PHIL_2649-1024x576.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "tag": "sexual health", "section": "In the Lab", "published_time": "2017-07-10T22:30:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-10T21:01:56+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A new study suggests that a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also ward off the sexually transmitted infection.", "title": "Vaccine shows protection against gonorrhea for first time, study says", "site": "@statnews", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Gonorrhea_PHIL_2649-1024x576.jpg", "creator": "@HelenBranswell"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/10/gonorrhea-vaccine-study/?ia_markup=1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1324796990", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-328x328.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499659200.0, "source": "https://www.statnews.com", "summary": ""}
