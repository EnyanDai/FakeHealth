The ability to accurately locate the cancers helps physicians make better and earlier diagnoses\u2014and may eventually make possible targeted nuclear-medicine therapies that identify and kill cancer cells, but not the surrounding healthy cells.\n\nThis summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved two such tests\u2014one can trace slow-growing prostate cancer cells, while the other targets a rare condition where neuroendocrine cells develop into tumors. Advanced Accelerator Applications, a French pharmaceutical company that developed the test for neuroendocrine tumors, also is seeking approval for a drug called Lutathera that uses the same technique to zero in on the cancer that needs treating, says Chief Executive Stefano Buono.\n\nFinding the fuel\n\nDeveloped in the 1970s, nuclear imaging is used to reveal the body\u2019s metabolic activities (in contrast with static imaging, such as X-rays, which provide just a snapshot). Positron emission tomography, or PET, scans can be used to identify many common cancers, as well as Alzheimer\u2019s and epilepsy.\n\nBut many PET scans aren\u2019t effective at locating certain cancers, including cancer of the prostate, the third most common type of cancer in the U.S., with more than 180,000 new cases and more than 26,000 deaths expected this year. That\u2019s because the most common imaging agent, known as FDG, uses glucose to locate cancer cells. Prostate and several other cancers don\u2019t use as much glucose, so the scans aren\u2019t effective for those diseases.\n\nThe new tests pair radioactive materials with a receptor that reacts to a hormone for neuroendocrine tumors or, in the case of prostate cancer, amino acid, which is what fuels the disease. The result is a better view of the cancer.\n\nSpotting a relapse\n\nBlue Earth Diagnostics Ltd., based in Oxford, England, developed the prostate imaging agent, called Axumin, based on a molecule originally developed by Mark Goodman, a professor of radiology and imaging sciences at Emory University\u2019s School of Medicine in the mid-1990s. The agent was administered commercially for the first time in September at a hospital in Atlanta.\n\nWith recurrent prostate cancer, the test\u2019s ability to locate cancer at the cellular level means that it can complement current diagnostic tests.\n\nProstate-specific antigen, or PSA, is the common way to screen for the disease. But it isn\u2019t entirely reliable because the PSA protein count also rises with age and disease of the prostate like inflammation, and it doesn\u2019t help to determine the location of the tumor. That can be crucial in deciding on treatment. If the cancer is confined to the pelvis, surgery or radiation can be used to treat the disease. But if it has spread to lymph nodes or the bones, hormone therapy may be required.\n\nThe test also allows for earlier detection of recurrent disease. An estimated 20% to 30% of men who are treated for prostate cancer will relapse after five years, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe new scan can detect cancer with a relatively low PSA count, say, under 5, when the cancer may still be curable,\u201d says Mark Scholz, founder and executive director of the non-profit Prostate Cancer Research Institute. \u201cThat changes everything.\u201d\n\nThere are other efforts seeking to screen for cancer on a cellular level. Genetic testing, for example, looks for inherited mutations in a person\u2019s genes to gauge the risk of developing hereditary cancer, and allow patients to be on guard even before any symptoms appear. Still, nuclear imaging can provide complementary information to these newer methods. For one, nuclear imaging can see how the tumor behaves in the body and its immediate environment and can be used to inform physicians about changes in the disease during the course of treatment, says Dr. Janet Eary, a deputy associate director at the National Cancer Institute\u2019s cancer-imaging program.\n\nMs. Or is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.
