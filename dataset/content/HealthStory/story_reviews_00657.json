In the studies detailed on Sunday, both drugs reduced the bad cholesterol by about 60 percent, to about 50 milligrams per deciliter from about 120 at the start of the studies. In many cases such big reductions were achieved even though the patients were already taking statins.\n\nBoth drugs could win approval from the Food and Drug Administration by this summer. Analysts say the drugs will have billions of dollars in annual sales and will be taken by millions of people who cannot lower their cholesterol enough using statins alone or cannot tolerate statins. (However, the PCSK9 drugs are taken by injection every two weeks or four weeks, which could deter some users.)\n\nStatins reduce cardiovascular risk and scientists believe it is because they decrease low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol. But merely looking at cholesterol levels can be misleading. The drug niacin did not protect against heart attacks and strokes even though it raised so-called good cholesterol and modestly lowered bad cholesterol.\n\nInsurers in particular might demand proof that the PCSK9 drugs stave off heart attacks, strokes, deaths from coronary disease and procedures to open arteries before agreeing to pay for them for many patients. Executives at CVS Health, a leading pharmacy benefits manager, recently said that PCSK9 inhibitors might cost $7,000 to $12,000 a year and would strain health care budgets because so many people might use them.\n\n\u201cManaged care pharmacy, indeed the health care system, has never seen a challenge like this to our resilience in absorbing costs,\u201d they wrote in the Health Affairs blog.\n\nWhether the results from these two small studies will be persuasive enough remains to be seen.\n\nThe study of Amgen\u2019s evolocumab involved 4,465 patients with various degrees of risk, two-thirds of whom were randomly chosen to get the drug in addition to the medication they were already taking. After one year, 0.95 percent of those in the group that received the drug had suffered a heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular problem, compared with 2.18 percent in the group that did not take the drug. By a measure known as the hazard ratio, the risk of cardiovascular events was reduced by 53 percent.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/tests-of-cholesterol-drugs-offer-hope-of-reducing-heart-attacks-and-strokes.html", "title": "Tests of Cholesterol Drugs Offer Hope of Reducing Heart Attacks and Strokes", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-03-15T15:54:35.000Z", "modified": "2015-03-15T15:54:27.000Z", "section": "Business", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-pollack", "tag": "San Diego (Calif)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003573129, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/6fa258ac-aa43-5fad-8a2e-73dafe509b43", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/e0ffcd1019d1435db6c84d4bd1cf6b67", "description": "Researchers cautioned, however, that the studies were small and meant to assess whether the drugs safely lowered cholesterol, not whether they staved off heart attacks.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "byl": "By Andrew Pollack", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": "Cholesterol,,The New England Journal of Medicine,Heart,Stroke,Pharmaceuticals,Amgen,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,Sanofi,Statins,Steven E Nissen,Cleveland Clinic,Los Angeles,San Diego", "pdate": 20150315, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/tests-of-cholesterol-drugs-offer-hope-of-reducing-heart-attacks-and-strokes.html", "type": "article", "title": "Tests of Cholesterol Drugs Offer Hope of Reducing Heart Attacks and Strokes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "description": "Researchers cautioned, however, that the studies were small and meant to assess whether the drugs safely lowered cholesterol, not whether they staved off heart attacks."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/tests-of-cholesterol-drugs-offer-hope-of-reducing-heart-attacks-and-strokes.html", "title": "Tests of Cholesterol Drugs Offer Hope of Reducing Heart Attacks and Strokes", "description": "Researchers cautioned, however, that the studies were small and meant to assess whether the drugs safely lowered cholesterol, not whether they staved off heart attacks.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003573129"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "business", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/tests-of-cholesterol-drugs-offer-hope-of-reducing-heart-attacks-and-strokes.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003573129", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/tests-of-cholesterol-drugs-offer-hope-of-reducing-heart-attacks-and-strokes.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/tests-of-cholesterol-drugs-offer-hope-of-reducing-heart-attacks-and-strokes.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1426478400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
