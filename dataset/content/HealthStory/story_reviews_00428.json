Some scientists say this unnatural position can lead to pain, headaches and other symptoms, sometimes collectively called \u201ctext neck.\u201d\n\nThe Claim: Technology itself comes to the rescue. An Android app called the Text Neck Indicator measures the angle of your phone and lets you know when you\u2019re holding it in a favorable viewing position. And a new wearable device, Alex, monitors the angle of your neck and vibrates when your posture is poor.\n\nThe Verdict: Neither product has been tested in a human study. Some scientists say the technological nannies are a good idea. Others caution that neck pain and headaches have complex causes, and\u2014to the surprise of some researchers\u2014a recent study found that better posture doesn\u2019t necessarily prevent pain.\n\nThe Text Neck Indicator, invented by Plantation, Fla., chiropractor Dean L. Fishman, shows a green light when your phone is tilted toward you at an \u201cacceptable\u201d viewing angle, defined by the app as at least 65 degrees from the horizontal, says Dr. Fishman. The goal is to encourage people to use their phones with their head in neutral position, with the ears over the shoulders, rather than craned forward, he says. Dr. Fishman has trademarked the term Text Neck.\n\nNamu\u2019s Alex vibrates when the neck is tilted too far forward. Photo: Namu\n\nAlex, a small device worn behind the neck from Namu Inc. of Seoul, vibrates when the neck is tilted too far forward. Using an iPhone or Android app, the user calibrates the device by touching the screen when in good posture and poor posture. Alex was launched on Kickstarter and sells on Indiegogo for $99.\n\nIf you already have pain, \u201cthere may be a benefit if you use something like this in conjunction with an exercise program that strengthens neck muscles and muscles stabilizing the head,\u201d says Alan S. Hilibrand, professor of spinal surgery at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\n\nIn 2014, a study in the journal Surgical Technology International used a computer model to calculate that the force to the cervical spine\u2014the seven vertebrae in the neck region\u2014increased from 10 or 12 pounds with the head in a neutral position to 27 pounds at a 15-degree forward tilt and 49 pounds at 45 degrees.\n\nThe extra force results in more load on discs, which can eventually degenerate and lead to chronic neck pain, says study co-author Kenneth K. Hansraj, a cervical surgeon in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Technological reminders, such as Alex and the Text Neck Indicator, can help \u201craise awareness\u201d about good posture, adds Dr. Hansraj, who has no link to Dr. Fishman or Namu.\n\nThe Text Neck Indicator app. Photo: Dean Fishman\n\nSome scientists say that, for reasons not yet fully understood, poor posture doesn\u2019t appear to be as linked to neck pain as common sense would suggest. A study of 1,108 adolescents published earlier in May in the journal of the American Physical Therapy Association found no link between posture, including neck tilted forward, and either pain or headaches.\n\n\u201cCan you say to the whole population: If you improve your posture you reduce your risk of neck pain? We haven\u2019t the evidence to say that,\u201d says study co-author Leon M. Straker. a professor of physiotherapy at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. Still, devices such as Alex could be helpful for certain people who have noticed that their pain increases with prolonged periods in poor posture, he adds.\n\nIn testing Alex, I liked that I could adjust the neck tilt the device considered \u201cbad,\u201d which allowed me to set reasonable goals. I also liked that the device allowed me to choose how long it gave me before vibrating to warn of poor posture. I chose to have it vibrate after my neck had been craned forward for a minute.\n\nIn a brief test of the Text Neck Indicator, on a friend\u2019s Android phone, I found that tilting the device until the light turned green improved my posture from my habitual neck crane to a smaller bend forward. To achieve a neutral position, I needed to not only tilt the phone as prompted by the app, but also move it high in front of my face.\n\nThat illustrates the trade-off between improving your neck angle and potentially causing your shoulders and arms to hurt, says Jack Dennerlein, director of the occupational biomechanics and ergonomics laboratory at Northeastern University in Boston. To reduce stress on muscles when raising the phone, hold your arms closer to your body, says Dr. Fishman, adding that holding the phone at a proper angle and height gets easier with improved strength and muscle memory.\n\nCraning your neck occasionally isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it is best for the body to move and change positions often, says Eric K. Robertson, director of graduate physical therapy education for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California and a spokesman for the American Physical Therapy Association. When you\u2019re working on a computer or using a device, try to take a break every 15 or 20 minutes and stretch or change position, he says.\n\n\u2014 Write to Laura Johannes at aches@wsj.com",
