REUTERS/Luke MacGregor\n\nThe analysis, which appeared in the Journal of Urology, compared increasingly common robotic surgery with two other techniques for the same surgery and found that direct costs can be up to several thousand dollars higher for the robotic type.\n\nTouted as less invasive and more efficient, robotic surgeries typically use a laparoscopic or \u201ckeyhold surgery\u201d approach, in which tools and a tiny video camera are inserted into the body through one or two small incisions.\n\nRobotic surgery replaces a surgeon\u2019s hands with ultra-precise tools at the ends of mechanical arms, all operated by the surgeon from a console.\n\n\u201cI think the take home message is that robotic (surgery), looking at our study, had certain beneficial outcomes compared to open and laparoscopic procedures,\u201d said study leader Jim Hu at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston.\n\nHu and his team analyzed surgery data from a national government database to see if the costlier robotic surgeries were cost effective with extra benefits over older techniques.\n\nDuring the last three months of 2008 \u2014 the most recent data available that allowed a comparison among robotic, open and laparoscopic surgeries \u2014 more than half of all prostate removals involved robot-assisted surgery.\n\nAbout three percent of prostate patients had standard laparoscopic surgery and 44 percent had open surgery. Open and laparoscopic surgeries were still more common than robotic surgeries for kidney repairs and removals.\n\nAmong patients who had their prostate removed, none died from laparoscopic or robotic surgery, whereas two out of every 1,000 died after the open procedure.\n\nAbout five percent of the men who had open surgery needed a blood transfusion, compared to less than two percent of men who had robot-assisted surgery. The open-surgery group also stayed in the hospital about one day longer than the robotic group.\n\nThe results were similar for people who had kidneys removed.\n\nThe trade-off was the cost, with robotic prostate removal costing about $10,000 on average, roughly $700 more than laparoscopic surgery and $1,100 more than open surgery.\n\nFor kidney removal, robotic surgery cost $13,900, which was $2,700 more than laparoscopic and $1,300 more than open surgery.\n\nDavid Penson, a surgeon at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not part of the study, said more consideration should have been given to the state of patients afterwards. Emphasis should be lmited on procedure, he said, as opposed to surgical skill.\n\n\u201cYears ago, this was thought to be the be-all-end-all operation, particularly with prostate surgery. We were going to get patients out of the hospital quicker, have better potency and incontinence outcomes,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\n\"And the reality of it is that... there are some benefits -- but not as much as we had hoped.\" SOURCE: bit.ly/zZIYa1", "images": ["https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120305&t=2&i=578684398&w=1200&r=BTRE82412J100", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120305&t=2&i=578684398&r=BTRE82412J100&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120305&t=2&i=578684398&w=1200&r=BTRE82412J100", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robots-surgery-idUSTRE82405320120305", "title": "Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;future-of-healthcare;medical-research;technology-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "Patients who have robot-assisted surgeries on their kidneys or prostate have shorter hospital stays and a lower risk of having a blood transfusion or dying -- but the bill is significantly higher, a study found.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "David Benson,Jim Courtovich He,Luke Macgregor,US,ROBOTS,SURGERY,General News,Technology (TRBC),Company News,Health / Medicine,Living / Lifestyle,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Healthcare (TRBC),Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,United States", "news_keywords": "David Benson;Jim Courtovich He;Luke Macgregor;US;ROBOTS;SURGERY;General News;Technology (TRBC);Company News;Health / Medicine;Living / Lifestyle;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Healthcare (TRBC);Human Interest / Brights / Odd News;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Mar 05 13:52:12 UTC 2012", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2012-03-05T13:52:12+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robots-surgery-idUSTRE82405320120305", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "David Benson,Jim Courtovich He,Luke Macgregor,US,ROBOTS,SURGERY,General News,Technology (TRBC),Company News,Health / Medicine,Living / Lifestyle,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Healthcare (TRBC),Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-ROBOTS-SURGERY", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2012-03-05T13:52:12+0000", "sailthru.title": "Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robots-surgery-idUSTRE82405320120305", "type": "article", "description": "Patients who have robot-assisted surgeries on their kidneys or prostate have sho...", "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120305&t=2&i=578684398&w=1200&r=BTRE82412J100", "article": {"published_time": "2012-03-05T13:52:12+0000", "modified_time": "2012-03-05T13:52:12+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "David Benson,Jim Courtovich He,Luke Macgregor,US,ROBOTS,SURGERY,General News,Technology (TRBC),Company News,Health / Medicine,Living / Lifestyle,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Healthcare (TRBC),Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Robotic surgeries costlier but safer: study", "description": "Patients who have robot-assisted surgeries on their kidneys or prostate have shorter hospital stays and a lower risk of having a blood transfusion or dying -- but the bill is significantly higher, a s...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120305&t=2&i=578684398&w=1200&r=BTRE82412J100", "src": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120305&t=2&i=578684398&w=1200&r=BTRE82412J100"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
