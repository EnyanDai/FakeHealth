As people age, their mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy for your cells, become less efficient.\n\nHigh intensity interval training essentially \"reversed\" many \"age-related differences\" in aspects of elderly participants' mitochondria, the researchers wrote in the study's summary.\n\nDr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, called the study's findings \"very interesting.\"\n\n\"When they looked at the cellular level, the changes they saw in the older people\u2019s cells with the high-intensity [training] made those cells look more like younger people\u2019s cells in terms of how they handled energy,\u201d Besser said today on \"Good Morning America.\" \u201cThat was very interesting.\u201d\n\nChris Powell, trainer and transformation specialist on ABC's \u201cExtreme Weight Loss,\" said the term high-intensity interval training can be \"terrifying\" to people, but it should not be.\n\n\"High intensity interval training is just aerobic training with short bouts of weight training in between,\" Powell said today on \"GMA.\" \"The beauty of it though is that we get to control the throttle of our own workouts.\"\n\nHe continued, \"It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an elite athlete or you haven\u2019t moved for 10 years...It\u2019s all about completing, not competing.\"\n\nBesser advised people to consult with their medical doctor before beginning any new exercise regimen, including high-intensity interval training.\n\nThis training, also known as HIIT, can be done using just your own body weight and with minimal to no equipment, according to Powell.\n\nAerobic training can be accomplished by jump roping, running in place or doing jumping jacks or high knees, the trainer said. Weight training can be done with exercises such as push ups, lunges and back squats.\n\nPowell demonstrated a HIIT workout of 20 high knees combined with 10 back lunges.\n\n\"It\u2019s that simple,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a million different combinations. You can do it so many different ways.\"", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY-Exercising-jrl-170307_16x9_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY-Exercising-jrl-170307_12x5_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY-Exercising-jrl-170307_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/high-intensity-interval-training-anti-aging-benefits-study/story?id=45981168", "title": "High-intensity interval training may have anti-aging benefits, study finds", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "High intensity interval training could be the secret to staying young.", "keywords": "High Intensity Interval Training, health, youth, longevity, young, fitness, weight,health news, medical news, medical articles", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2017-03-08T12:03:18:809-08", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Interval training may have anti-aging benefits, study finds", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "Interval training may have anti-aging benefits, study finds", "description": "High intensity interval training could be the secret to staying young.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/high-intensity-interval-training-anti-aging-benefits-study/story?id=45981168", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY-Exercising-jrl-170307_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "High Intensity Interval Training, health, youth, longevity, young, fitness, weight", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "Interval training may have anti-aging benefits, study finds", "description": "High intensity interval training could be the secret to staying young.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/high-intensity-interval-training-anti-aging-benefits-study/story?id=45981168", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY-Exercising-jrl-170307_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,45981168", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,45981168", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/high-intensity-interval-training-anti-aging-benefits-study/story?id=45981168"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,45981168", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,45981168", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/high-intensity-interval-training-anti-aging-benefits-study/story?id=45981168", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/high-intensity-interval-training-anti-aging-benefits-study/story?id=45981168"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
