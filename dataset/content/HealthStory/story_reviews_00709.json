It also boosts good cholesterol, reduces fatty deposits in the liver and lowers blood sugar, they add.\n\nThe Verdict: Bergamot has been shown to lower cholesterol in at least four human studies published or presented at scientific meetings. But much of the work is authored by a group of Italian researchers who work closely with a company that sells the extract, scientists say. Larger, independent studies in other countries are needed to confirm the results, they say.\n\nBergamot fruit grows on sunny slopes in Southern Italy and are rich in substances called flavonoids, which likely are the reason for its beneficial effects says Arrigo Cicero, a scientist in the atherosclerosis and metabolic disease research unit of the University of Bologna. But he adds that he feels additional human studies are needed to prove efficacy.\n\nFlavonoids are antioxidants, or substances some scientists believe reduce chemical reactions in the body that damage cells. Earl Grey tea likely contains too little bergamot to have a therapeutic effect, scientists say, though the tea is high in another class of antioxidant called catechins.\n\nBergamot supplements, often in 500 milligram or 650 milligram capsules or tablets, are intended to be taken before meals. In human studies, a bergamot extract was shown effective at a dose of 500 milligrams to 1,500 milligrams a day, according to published results.\n\nIn a monthlong study of 77 patients published in 2013 in the International Journal of Cardiology, 1,000 milligrams daily of bergamot extract lowered cholesterol from an average of 278 milligrams per deciliter of blood to 191.\n\nBergamot Cholesterol Support, a new product from Reserveage Nutrition LLC of Gainesville, Fla., combines the citrus extract with resveratrol, an antioxidant derived from grapes and Japanese knotweed.

Dr. Mollace, a cardiologist, is a paid scientific consultant to Italy\u2019s Herbal & Antioxidant Derivatives Srl, which sells the extract for use in dietary supplements.\n\n\u201cThe data looks very good,\u201d says David Frid, a staff physician in the section of preventive cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cBut it would be beneficial for this to be reproduced [by another research group] in order to say that in fact this is a true cholesterol-lowering effect.\u201d\n\nWhile Dr. Mollace\u2019s study showed mild heartburn as the only side effect, larger long-term studies are needed to establish safety.\n\n\u201cI would tell a patient the caveat is, \u2018If you want to try it, you need to be aware that we don\u2019t really know its side effects,\u2019 \u201d says Dr. Frid. In addition, he adds, statins have been shown to improve health outcomes, such as reducing heart attacks, while bergamot hasn\u2019t yet met that rigorous test.\n\nA glass of bergamot juice tastes like sour grapefruit, making capsules a palatable way to ingest a therapeutic dose, says Annie Eng, chief executive of HP Ingredients Inc., a Bradenton, Fla., company that sells its Bergamonte brand extract to about 30 U.S. dietary-supplement companies.\n\nSome brands combine bergamot with other ingredients. Bergamot Cholesterol Support, a new product from Reserveage Nutrition LLC of Gainesville, Fla., combines the citrus extract with resveratrol, an antioxidant derived from grapes and Japanese knotweed.\n\nThe company hasn\u2019t studied the combination, but it \u201clogically it would make sense\u201d that the two would work well together, says Rob Maru, the company\u2019s chief innovation officer.\n\nThe amount of plant flavonoids in dietary supplements with bergamot will vary significantly depending on the fruit itself and how it is processed, scientists say. BergaMet Mega from Australia\u2019s Nathealthsolutions Pty Ltd., is formulated to have the same potency of flavonoids as used in Dr. Mollace\u2019s studies, says Chief Executive Selwyn Barr.\n\nDr. Mollace, who serves as an unpaid scientific advisor to Nathealthsolutions, confirmed that BergaMet has the same concentration of flavonoids as the extract he studied.\n\n\u2014Email aches@wsj.com",
