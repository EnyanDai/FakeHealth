He couldn\u2019t sleep. He was irritable and had anger issues. He would avoid certain stressful situations, like driving in traffic. And he would stay on high alert in the classroom.\n\n\u201cAnd then soon, they\u2019re like, 'You\u2019re not the same,'\u201d Merkle recalled of what his family told him. \u201cThey start to notice that you\u2019re not really enjoying the parties of our friends. You only get really excited when you're going to visit former Marines and the people you used to hang out with.\u201d\n\nChris Merkle\n\nMerkle served three tours in Iraq and four in Afghanistan. Re-adjusting to being a civilian was tough, he said, and he was finding it difficult to function.\n\n\u201cThere was almost 5, 10 years of deploying back and forth back and forth -- there was this void, this monster in the room that\u2019s not talked about until finally it came out. It was like, 'You need to see somebody. Something is going on with you.'\"\n\nWhile Merkle was a patient at the VA, he heard of a clinical psychologist named Skip Rizzo at the University of Southern California Institute of Creative Technologies. Merkle was trying traditional one-on-one therapy and said that at the time, \u201cit wasn\u2019t really taking that well.\u201d He was looking for an alternative and heard about Skip\u2019s research that used a new and unexpected way to treat post-traumatic stress disorder -- with virtual reality.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cFinding the Next\u201d full episodes will release Tuesdays on ABCNews.com and ABC News' mobile apps. The entire series is available now on ABC News apps on Apple TV, Roku and Xbox One.\n\nNearly 8 million adults suffer from PTSD during a given year, according to the National Center for PTSD. The condition can occur after someone has been exposed to a significant stressor and often includes symptoms such as avoidance, hyper-vigilance, anger issues and mood swings. One common method for treatment is called \u201cexposure therapy.\u201d The patient recounts their trauma, visualizing it in their imagination, and narrates it to a clinician. By repeatedly confronting and processing the trauma, the brain can start to reduce the level of anxiety and response to those memories.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the approach Rizzo uses with virtual reality therapy.\n\n\u201cMy mission is to drag psychology kicking and screaming into the 21st century,\u201d Rizzo said, noting that virtual reality offers a unique opportunity for clinicians and clients alike: to be immersed in the environment that evokes the original trauma, rather than relying on the patient\u2019s imagination.\n\nRizzo has created 14 virtual \u201cworlds\u201d for patients, and clinicians can add custom elements, including helicopters, clouds, small-arms fire and missiles.\n\nUSC Institute for Creative Technologies\n\n\u201cThe first thing to keep in mind is that we are never going to replicate an exact simulation of what the patient went through,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cBut we really don\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\nMerkle explained how the virtual reality experience works. \u201cYour brain assumes, 'OK, this must be where we\u2019re at,' and it fills in the blanks. And as you\u2019re talking through it, you feel like you\u2019re physically there.\u201d\n\nEach session lasts for about an hour and a half, and the patient speaks about their experience with a clinician as they go through the virtual simulation.\n\nFor Merkle, virtual reality allowed him to start unlocking memories and work through his trauma.\n\n\u201cSo, it really allowed me to open the door and begin my healing process,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still a work in process obviously but I\u2019m so far forward, leaps and bound beyond where I would have been without virtual reality.\u201d\n\nFor more stories from our \u201cFinding the Next\u201d series, hit the bell in ABC News\u2019 phone app. Download ABC News for iPhone here or ABC News for Android here.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/HT_ptsd_2_chris_merkle_jt_160711_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/ABC_ptsd_3_chris_merkle_jt_160711_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/HT_ptsd_4_checkpoint_rolling_vr_simulation_jt_160711_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/ABC_ptsd_3_chris_merkle_jt_160711_31x13_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/ABC_ptsd_1_chris_merkle_jt_160711_4x3_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/ABC_ptsd_3_chris_merkle_jt_160711_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Justine Quart"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/treating-ptsd-virtual-reality-therapy-heal-trauma/story?id=38742665", "title": "Treating PTSD With Virtual Reality Therapy: A Way to Heal Trauma", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Skip Rizzo is a clinical psychologist who uses virtual reality to help patients, including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.", "keywords": "Virtual Reality, technology, VR, PTSD, psychology, science, health,science news, technology news, gadget news", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2017-02-15T17:33:11:369-08", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "How Virtual Reality Can Help Heal Mental Trauma", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "How Virtual Reality Can Help Heal Mental Trauma", "description": "Skip Rizzo is a clinical psychologist who uses virtual reality to help patients, including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/treating-ptsd-virtual-reality-therapy-heal-trauma/story?id=38742665", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/ABC_ptsd_3_chris_merkle_jt_160711_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "Virtual Reality, technology, VR, PTSD, psychology, science, health", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "@justinequart", "title": "How Virtual Reality Can Help Heal Mental Trauma", "description": "Skip Rizzo is a clinical psychologist who uses virtual reality to help patients, including veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/treating-ptsd-virtual-reality-therapy-heal-trauma/story?id=38742665", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/ABC_ptsd_3_chris_merkle_jt_160711_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,38742665", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,38742665", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Technology/treating-ptsd-virtual-reality-therapy-heal-trauma/story?id=38742665"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,38742665", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,38742665", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Technology/treating-ptsd-virtual-reality-therapy-heal-trauma/story?id=38742665", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/treating-ptsd-virtual-reality-therapy-heal-trauma/story?id=38742665"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
