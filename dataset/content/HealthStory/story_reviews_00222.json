Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cI tell my patients, \u2018buyer beware,\u2019\u201d Shepard said in an email. \u201cI tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.\u201d\n\nIf chondroitin doesn\u2019t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID \u201cperiodically,\u201d and to be aware of the side effects.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,\u201d Shepard cautioned.\n\nDr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is \u201creasonable to try\u201d for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.\n\n\u201cHowever, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,\u201d said Wolfe, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cChondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,\u201d Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. \u201cStudies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.\u201d\n\nThe study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2rcPLh0 Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, online May 22, 2017.", "images":
