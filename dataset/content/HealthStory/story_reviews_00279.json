There\u2019s a Jet Lag Eraser, for use after hopping off a long international flight, a Detoxification saline smoothie for \u201cimproving alertness and mental acuity,\u201d and a Late Night Rescue cocktail to undo the effects of too many actual cocktails the night before.\n\nThe company claims liquid vitamins, minerals, and amino acids delivered straight to the bloodstream can protect users from getting a cold, boost athletic performance, \u201cannihilate toxins,\u201d and stave off headaches. \u201cWe put together the ideal combination for them to obtain the results they want: clearer skin, clearer mind, better hair, better nails,\u201d said Dr. Erika Schwartz, who runs the clinic.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd though the IV lends a medical air to the procedure, the infusions suffer from the same problem as many supplements taken orally \u2014 there isn\u2019t any robust evidence to back up their health claims.\n\n\u201cSupplements don\u2019t fix anything and they don\u2019t prevent anything. It\u2019s simple,\u201d said Dr. Pete Miller, a clinician and nutrition researcher at Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe Evolved Science clinic in New York. Evolved Science\n\nVitamin IV infusions aren\u2019t anything new. Celebrities from Simon Cowell and Rihanna to the Real Housewives have proclaimed their love for vitamin drips. They\u2019re part of a huge \u2014 and wildly popular \u2014 supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren\u2019t allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health.\n\nThe infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers\u2019 cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers\u2019 cocktail \u2014 but it\u2019s just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions.\n\nThe research on injectable vitamins of any kind is thin and the results unimpressive. One study looked at injectable vitamins to treat asthma, but there was no placebo group to compare outcomes against. Two studies have examined intravenous vitamin use in fibromyalgia patients. One didn\u2019t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. The other \u2014 which was also missing a placebo group \u2014 involved just seven patients and showed only short-term improvement in symptoms.\n\nSchwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing it in a sterile environment, it\u2019s administered by a nurse, and everything is sterile,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only difference is it\u2019s kind of a beautiful environment.\u201d\n\nCustomers at Evolved Science shell out anywhere from $325 to $875 for an infusion. For first-time clients, Schwartz recommends weekly injections for the first month or so, and then a routine infusion once a month. Patients kick back in cream-colored chairs together while they\u2019re hooked up to IVs in the \u201cinfusion lounge.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like a doctor\u2019s office. It\u2019s very relaxed, not like a spa. But like a private club. It\u2019s a SoHo house kind of thing,\u201d said Schwartz, a former trauma surgeon.\n\nBut as for whether they\u2019ll help a client prepare for an important presentation?\n\n\u201cThere is not not substantial evidence that vitamin supplements have a large impact on cognitive function,\u201d said Dr. Francine Grodstein, a public health researcher at Harvard who has studied the subject. A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.\n\nStill, the trend seems to be going strong. The I.V. Doc \u2014 an in-home vitamin infusion service \u2014 offers on-demand nutrient drips in places including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and the Hamptons. In Las Vegas, hangover buses deliver pick-me-up infusions on the go.\n\nAnd despite a lack of sound evidence, experts expect consumers to keep coming back for infusions.\n\n\u201cWhat drives the market is not the science,\u201d said Miller. \u201cIn spite of that lack of evidence, there\u2019s still a market for it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IVClinic_DSC_1023-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsletter-Logo-Images-DR.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/stat-logo.svg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/plugins/stat-lazy-load/images/330x400-00000000.png", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=46858&fmt=gif", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Megan-Thielking_avatar_1462974211.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/FRUIT_IV_02-645x645.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=436331036555416&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IVClinic_DSC_1023-768x512.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IVClinic_DSC_1023-1024x683.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Thielking", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Sharon Begley", "Elizabeth Preston", "Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/23/vitamin-iv-infusion/", "title": "Vitamin IVs make bold health promises.
