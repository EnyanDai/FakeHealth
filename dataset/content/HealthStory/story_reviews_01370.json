One of the best studies the panel found focused on healthy women over age 65 and concluded that screenings spaced eight years or less apart did not make much of a difference in identifying which women would be more at risk for fractures.\n\nThe report identified possible benefits of screening, but noted that there is no solid evidence \u2014 in the form of randomized trials, medicine\u2019s gold standard \u2014 comparing fracture rates of patients who have been screened with those who have not been screened.\n\nBut the panel is in the process of updating its recommendations, which were issued in 2002. A preliminary report in July packed a surprise: No direct evidence was found that testing patients for low bone density helped avoid broken bones. \u201cIt\u2019s still amazing to me,\u2019\u2019 said the report\u2019s lead author, Dr. Heidi Nelson, a professor at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\nThe task force offers no advice for women younger than 60 or for men of any age, though men account for at least 20 percent of US patients with osteoporosis.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force, which sets standards on disease prevention and primary care, suggests that all women get a bone density screening by age 65, or by 60 if a patient might be at high risk for fractures. Risk factors include being female, having a family history of osteoporosis or broken bones, being small and thin, and having low levels of sex hormones, in addition to older age.\n\nOne of the first dilemmas patients typically encounter is when to get screened for osteoporosis, and then how often to repeat the test \u2014 a painless body scan that measures bone density.\n\n\u201cWhat is right in 2010,\u2019\u2019 she said, \u201cmight not be right in 2011 in a rapidly evolving medical science.\u2019\u2019\n\nDr. Felicia Cosman, clinical director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation and a professor at Columbia University, said the swirl of new information makes it critical for patients to review with their physicians their treatment decisions.\n\nEven the issues of how much vitamin D adults should take and whether calcium supplements help keep bones strong have been matters of debate.\n\nThe safety of one of the most popular types of medication used to lessen the risk of fractures \u2014 bisphosphonates, such as Fosamax and Boniva \u2014 has also been questioned.\n\nOver the past several months, studies have raised questions about the effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis, a silent disease that weakens the bones of an estimated 10 million Americans, most over age 50.\n\nSorting through all the recent news about osteoporosis, or low bone density, can be dizzying.\n\nA task force of specialists appointed by the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research reported last month that long-term use of bisphosphonates, typically beyond five years, may increase a patient\u2019s risk of an unusual but serious type of thigh fracture. The panel reviewed 310 such cases and concluded that they represent less than one-half of 1 percent of all American patients taking bisphosphonates. However the panel also said it believed the number of such fractures is under-reported.\n\nThere is little dispute over the conclusion of several studies that bisphosphonates can be effective in lowering patients\u2019 risk of fractures, some by as much as 50 percent. But in recent months, questions have grown about their safety.\n\nBisphosphonates \u2014 the class of drugs that includes Fosamax, Boniva, and others \u2014 were approved by federal regulators in 1995 and have since been prescribed for millions of patients. Taken orally or by injection, the drugs work by slowing the growth of cells that break down bones, giving the edge to other cells that rebuild them.\n\nWhen it comes to the most popular type of osteoporosis treatment, bisphosphonates, the question is not so much about how much to take, but whether there are harmful consequences from long-term use.\n\nAn updated report on recommended levels for both nutrients is due next month from the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, which advises the federal government.\n\nThere are fewer differences of opinion among health professionals about calcium levels, with most recommending about 1,200 daily milligrams for adults over 50. However, the most extensive study on the calcium question, done by the Women\u2019s Health Initiative as a randomized controlled trial, was inconclusive. It found no significant reduction in fractures in the study population, which received supplements of 1,000 milligrams of calcium and 400 international units of vitamin D daily.\n\nBeyond the screening question, many physicians routinely ask patients about their calcium and vitamin D intake. The federal government recommends just 400 international units daily of vitamin D for adults over age 50, while the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends 800 to 1,000 units. Some doctors suggest doubling those higher amounts for post-menopausal women.\n\nWaiting until women are in their 60s to scan will result in missing many who could be diagnosed and treated, she said. \u201cThe reason you want to find people at the time of menopause is because there is acceleration [of bone loss] at this time,\u2019\u2019 Cosman said. This is when estrogen plummets, and estrogen helps protect bone health.\n\n\u201cI believe all women should have a bone screening test approximately at the time of menopause,\u2019\u2019 said Cosman, emphasizing that \u201cthis is my personal opinion as a specialist who treats women,\u2019\u2019 and not representative of her position with the National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n\nIn the absence of clear guidelines, many physicians make their own judgment calls.\n\n\u201cThe thigh is one of the strongest bones in the body and it\u2019s unusual for it to break,\u2019\u2019 said Columbia University professor Dr. Elizabeth Shane, the task force cochair and a specialist who has prescribed the medications to many of her osteoporosis patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to prove causality, but we found a pretty clear link,\u2019\u2019 Shane said.\n\nHer task force recommended that an international registry be created for tracking such cases to help researchers better pinpoint which patients might be at risk. It also called on the US Food and Drug Administration to change medication labeling to alert physicians and patients to the possibility of these unusual fractures, and to urge awareness of possible warning signs: prolonged groin or thigh pain.\n\nIn a statement, the FDA said it is reviewing the data and is considering changing the labeling on bisphosphonates. It also recommended that patients report groin or thigh pain to their physicians, but did not suggest they stop taking the medications unless ordered to do so by their doctors.\n\nQuestions also persist about the potential link between the medications and cancer of the esophagus.\n\nIn August, a team of researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that bisphosphonate use was not linked to an increased risk of stomach or esophageal cancer. The scientists reviewed about 80,000 patient records from a 6 million-person database in Britain.\n\nBut in September, a different group of scientists used the same database and concluded in an article in the British Medical Journal that bisphosphonates appeared to double the risk of esophageal cancer after about 5 years of use. Still, this group stressed the risk was very small, resulting in 2 cases of throat cancer in 1,000 people ages 60 to 79, compared with the normal rate of 1 per 1,000.\n\nSome doctors are giving their patients \u201cdrug holidays\u2019\u2019 in which they take them off the prescriptions for a while.\n\nThe question is, for how long?\n\n\u201cNobody really knows,\u2019\u2019 said Shane, the Columbia University professor. \u201cEvery patient has to be evaluated on a case by case basis.\u2019\u2019\n\nPhysicians face a tough choice when it comes to frail patients who have brittle bones. If they pull them off the medications because of the possible risk of serious side effects with longer-term use, there is little else to prescribe.\n\nFor Dr. Douglas C. Bauer, a professor at the University of California-San Francisco and a researcher who also treats many osteoporosis patients, the hardest decision is when to stop the drugs in patients who still have low bone density after five years of treatment but are not especially frail.\n\n\u201cIt was appropriate to treat them to begin with, but you are not clear on added benefit for prolonged use beyond five years,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cSo I ask them, \u2018What would you like to do?\u2019 And I explain the data and say it\u2019s a gray area, and I say we can decide together.\u2019\u2019\n\nKay Lazar can be reached at klazar@globe.com.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.", "images": ["http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/File-Based_Image_Resource/spacer.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/bcom_logo_printerfriendly.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/etaf/pointer_top.gif", "http://nytbglobe.112.2O7.net/b/ss/nytbglobe/1/H.19.3--NS/0", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/bcom_small.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/glogo.jpg", "http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/File-Based_Image_Resource/from_provider_globe.gif", "http://graphics.boston.com/images/registration/truste2007/TRUSTe_Certified_Privacy.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/jobs/i/waiting.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/etaf/loading_icon.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/waiting.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/icons/share/bcom_og_news.gif", "http://rmedia.boston.com/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/www.boston.com/news/health/default/@SPONSOR", "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/etaf/pointer_bottom.gif", "http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/File-Based_Image_Resource/dingbat_story_end_icon.gif"], "top_img": "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/icons/share/bcom_og_news.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/10/11/sorting_through_advice_on_osteoporosis/", "title": "Sorting through advice on osteoporosis", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "og": {"title": "Sorting through advice on osteoporosis", "site_name": "Boston.com", "type": "article", "description": "Sorting through all the recent news about osteoporosis, or low bone density, can be dizzying.", "latitude": "52.0", "locality": "britain", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/icons/share/bcom_og_news.gif"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001044693856,507486035", "app_id": 117378991625799}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1286769600.0, "source": "http://www.boston.com", "summary": ""}
