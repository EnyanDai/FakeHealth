Gilchrest, a dermatology professor who is part of the research team, was on undereye bags, a condition that plagues so many middle-aged and older people.\n\n\u201cWe wanted something that is elegant, and the ultimate test is right there on your face,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really can\u2019t see it. It\u2019s there. It looks normal. We saw that as a very high bar. If you can achieve that you\u2019ve done something impressive.\u201d\n\n(The researchers emphasize that the second skin is significantly different from a product that Living Proof tried to market a few years ago as a cosmetic that could correct undereye bags.)\n\nThose studies included tests on people with undereye bags and those with dry skin on their legs. In one study, participants put second skin on their forearms to see how quickly the skin returned to normal after it was pinched in a suction cup \u2014 a test of elasticity. In another study, people were randomly assigned to use second skin or a placebo under their eyes. Trained observers graded the subjects on the appearance of the undereye skin. The product\u2019s durability was tested in volunteers who wore it while running in heat and working up a sweat, while swimming, and while going out in a rainstorm.\n\nOne of the important uses, the researchers said, is in treating eczema and the sort of dry skin that comes with aging, with dry itchy patches on the back and legs that keep people up at night, scratching.\n\n\u201cWe tell people to pat their skin with a damp washcloth and put on a heavy moisturizer, but that only lasts a short time,\u201d Dr. Gilchrest said. \u201cThey end up with greasy goo all over the sheets, and they wake up in the middle of the night, terribly uncomfortable. We need something that was easier to use and didn\u2019t make a mess and stays. Which is what this stuff does.\u201d\n\nAnother application of the second skin is to keep drugs like cortisone creams on the skin, Dr. Anderson said. Less than 10 percent of what is applied stays there. \u201cThe other 90 percent ends up on your pillowcase or your clothes.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/10/science/10SKIN1/10SKIN1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/10/science/10SKIN1/10SKIN1-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/10/science/10SKIN1/10SKIN1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/health/second-skin-aging-wrinkles.html", "title": "\u2018Second Skin\u2019 May Reduce Wrinkles, Eyebags, Scientists Say", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2016-05-09T15:02:14.000Z", "modified": "2016-05-12T01:38:18.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata", "tag": "Cambridge (Mass)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004390749, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/d33e4af2-e51d-53bd-8138-ccb381a8322d", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/16d10b212481413583454350063f50f4", "description": "The researchers say an invisible film composed of polymers can be applied to the face and could make bags under the eyes, wrinkles and other dermatologic problems vanish.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/10/science/10SKIN1/10SKIN1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Gina Kolata", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/10/science/10SKIN1/10SKIN1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Nature Materials Journal,,Skin,FDA,Polymer,Cambridge Mass", "pdate": 20160509, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/health/second-skin-aging-wrinkles.html", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Second Skin\u2019 May Reduce Wrinkles, Eyebags, Scientists Say", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/10/science/10SKIN1/10SKIN1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "A photo published in Nature Materials accompanying research reporting early studies on a chemically manufactured second skin."}, "description": "The researchers say an invisible film composed of polymers can be applied to the face and could make bags under the eyes, wrinkles and other dermatologic problems vanish."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/health/second-skin-aging-wrinkles.html", "title": "\u2018Second Skin\u2019 May Reduce Wrinkles, Eyebags, Scientists Say", "description": "The researchers say an invisible film composed of polymers can be applied to the face and could make bags under the eyes, wrinkles and other dermatologic problems vanish.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/10/science/10SKIN1/10SKIN1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "A photo published in Nature Materials accompanying research reporting early studies on a chemically manufactured second skin."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004390749"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "CN": "editors-picks", "CT": "spotlight", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/health/second-skin-aging-wrinkles.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004390749", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/health/second-skin-aging-wrinkles.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/health/second-skin-aging-wrinkles.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1462852800.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
