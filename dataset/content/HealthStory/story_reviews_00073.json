The other option is minimally invasive hair transplant surgery. In the U.S., there are around 50 million men and 30 million women affected by hair loss, which U.K.-based researchers said could be the source of \u201cpsychological distress.\u201d\n\nIn a study conducted on human hair follicles, researchers investigated a drug called Cyclosporine A (CsA), which has been prescribed to treat immune disorders and transplant rejection since the 1980s. Side effects including shaking, headaches, vomiting and swollen gums\u2014as well as unwanted hair growth.\n\nREUTERS/Peter Macdiarmid\n\nThe research team, lead by Dr. Nathan Hawkshaw at the University of Manchester, investigated whether CsA could provide some clues for treating baldness.\n\nAfter treating hair with CsA, the scientists analyzed the gene expressions of isolated human scalp hair follicles. They found that CsA changed how the follicles expressed a protein called SFRP1, which stunts the development and growth of hair follicles and other tissues in the body.\n\nThe scientists were then able to identify that WAY-316606, a compound used to treat osteoporosis, has a similar effect on how SFRP1 is expressed.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe compound WAY-316606 could therefore be used to treat baldness, without patients suffering the same side effects as they would on CsA. The study was published in the journal PLOS Biology.\n\nDr. Hawkshaw said in a statement: \u201cThe fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair-loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly though, a clinical trial is required next to tell us whether this drug or similar compounds are both effective and safe in hair-loss patients.\u201d\n\nA British Association of Dermatologists spokesperson said in a statement the results were interesting.\n\n\u201cFor individuals with hair loss, treatments can be very hit and miss, there isn\u2019t one which is universally effective. For that reason new treatments are exciting as they give people more treatment options that may be effective.\n\n\u201cThis research has been tested on human tissue, which is promising, but not on humans themselves, so there is still some way to go.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to realise that this is being proposed as a treatment for hair loss, not a cure as such.\u201d\n\nThis piece has been updated with a comment from the British Assocation of Dermatologists.", "images":
