you can change circadian timing while you sleep, without interfering with sleep,\u201d he said.\n\nMistiming light therapy can make jet lag worse, cautioned Anna Wirz-Justice, professor emeritus at the Center for Chronobiology at the University of Basel in Switzerland, who was not part of the new study.\n\nAs for frequent flyers trying this themselves, it is \u201cfar too early \u2013 neither the methodology is available outside research, nor any guidance about safety, nor tests of simulated jet lag in an appropriate \u2018realistic\u2019 protocol,\u201d Wirz-Justice told Reuters Health by email.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1nYsDhD Journal of Clinical Investigation, online February 8, 2016.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathryn Doyle", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-circadian-light-flashes-idUSKCN0VH20X", "title": "Flashing night-lights may help lessen jet lag, circadian problems", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;medical-research;companies-mrch;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
