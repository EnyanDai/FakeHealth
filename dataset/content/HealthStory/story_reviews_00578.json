Experts now believe that the biological processes behind the neurodegenerative condition begin years, if not decades, before memory problems and confusion become noticeable.\n\nAt the annual Alzheimer\u2019s Association International Conference, researchers say they have found a series of substances in saliva that can distinguish between people who experience normal aging, those with mild cognitive dementia (MCI, which in some cases can lead to Alzheimer\u2019s and in other cases not), and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nPresenting at the meeting, Shraddha Sapkota, a graduate student in neuroscience at University of Alberta, and her colleagues described how they carefully analyzed the saliva of a group of volunteers participating in an aging study. Some had been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and some with MCI, while others did not have any neurological conditions. By comparing their saliva components, the scientists found that each of the three groups showed slightly different patterns of compounds, which could form the basis of a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.\n\nThe results aren\u2019t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s, but that\u2019s the goal, says Sapkota. Ideally, for example, isolating those with MCI might help doctors to focus in on a group of patients who might be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s and therefore might need more intensive and regular testing.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/brain1.jpg?quality=85&w=361&h=472&crop=1", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/brain1.jpg?quality=85&w=361&h=472&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alice Park"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/3963430/alzheimers-test-saliva/", "title": "Alzheimer\u2019s May Show Up in Saliva", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Alzheimer's,alzheimer's test,Brain,Research,saliva,saliva tests", "news_keywords": "alzheimer's, alzheimer's test, saliva test, mci, mild cognitive impairment", "description": "Identifying Alzheimer\u2019s well before symptoms appear may become easier with a saliva test that picks up differences among normally aging people, those with mild cognitive dementia, and people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "og": {"title": "Alzheimer's May Show Up in Saliva", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/3963430/alzheimers-test-saliva/", "description": "Identifying Alzheimer\u2019s well before symptoms appear may become easier with a saliva test", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/brain1.jpg?quality=85&w=361&h=472&crop=1", "width": 361, "height": 472}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/3963430/alzheimers-test-saliva/", "description": "Identifying Alzheimer\u2019s well before symptoms appear may become easier with a saliva test that picks up differences among normally aging people, those with mild cognitive dementia, and people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/brain1.jpg?quality=85&w=361&h=472&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/3963430/alzheimers-test-saliva/", "title": "Alzheimer's May Show Up in Saliva", "description": "Identifying Alzheimer\u2019s well before symptoms appear may become easier with a saliva test", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/brain1.jpg?quality=85&w=361&h=472&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
