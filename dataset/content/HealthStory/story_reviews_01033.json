He is also founder of Durin Technologies Inc., the company that is developing the test.\n\nThe research results on the new test are published online in PLoS ONE.\n\nHis test is one of numerous such tests under study, says Heather Snyder, PhD, a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Association, who reviewed the research results. \"Many labs are looking at this. They are all in the very preliminary, very early stages. We all know we need an accurate, relatively noninvasive way to diagnose Alzheimer's.\"\n\nLast month at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, Australian researchers reported good results for another blood test for Alzheimer's under development. It works by determining the amount of amyloid plaque, associated with the disease, in people's brains.\n\nAn estimated 5.4 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association.\n\nDoctors use brain imaging, evaluation of behavior, psychiatric tests, and other means to diagnose the disease. None are highly accurate, and some are costly and not practical to use on a widespread basis, experts say.\n\nThe only definitive way to diagnose the disease is by direct examination of brain tissue after the patient dies.", "images":
