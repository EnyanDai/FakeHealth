And the greater a woman\u2019s lifetime exposure to estrogen--whether her own or estrogen that comes from medication or environmental sources--the higher her risk of developing breast cancer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut red wine acts differently, the present study found. Instead of promoting the conversion of androgens to estrogen in a woman\u2019s body, red wine appears to block that process. In that sense, it acts more like a class of drug called aromatase inhibitors, which are prescribed to most women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer to prevent recurrences.\n\nIt\u2019s not the alcohol in red wine that appears to conjure such magic. It\u2019s the phytochemicals, which also are found in grapes, grape juice and grape seed extract. Resveratrol, one of the phytochemicals found plentifully in red wine, has been linked to a host of disease-preventing processes.\n\nResearchers led by a team from Cedars-Sinai\u2019s Heart Institute and Medical Center found that study participants who drank eight ounces of red wine daily (the equivalent of almost two servings at five ounces per serving) showed a significantly different mix of seven sex hormones than those who drank the same amount of white wine. Among the red wine drinkers, estrogen levels were lower and androgen levels were higher.\n\nThe current study was small--36 women, with an average age of 36, participated. Each drank eight ounces nightly of Cabernet Sauvignon wine for most of a single menstrual cycle, then drank no alcohol for a little over a week and then drank eight ounces of Chardonnay nightly for roughly the next 21 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe authors asserted this was the first rigorous study to find that red wine is a \u201cnutritional aromatase inhibitor in healthy premenopausal women.\u201d Another study has found that women who drank more red wine showed less breast density on mammograms--an emerging marker for breast cancer risk-- than those who drank other forms of alcohol.\n\nL\u2019chaim!", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd585f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F12%2F57%2Fa343371429b7000ea37eaded8d93%2Fimg-534f3749-turbine-la-bio-melissa-healy"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Healy Is A Health", "Science Reporter With The Los Angeles Times Writing The Washington", "D.C.", "Area.
