Researchers say this allows patients to re-examine traumatic memories.\n\nIn follow-up psychotherapy, patients process emotions and insights brought up during the MDMA session. The current protocol calls for patients to take MDMA two or three times, each a month apart, interspersed with psychotherapy.\n\n\u201cThe MDMA alone or the therapy alone don\u2019t appear to be as effective,\u201d Dr. Mithoefer said. \u201cThe MDMA seems to act as a catalyst that allows the healing to happen.\u201d\n\nWhat do patients say about it?\n\n\u201cI was actually able to forgive myself,\u201d said Nigel McCourry, 36 a Marine veteran who was deployed in 2004 to Falluja, Iraq, whose experiences mirrored those of three other patients interviewed.\n\nMr. McCourry came home from war unable to escape scenes of an explosion that nearly killed him, and haunted by the memory of two young girls he accidentally killed in a fire fight. He struggled to sleep. He drank to forget. Rage eroded most of his relationships.\n\nHe tried help at a Veterans Affairs hospital, but couldn\u2019t let his guard down enough to benefit from standard psychotherapy. A handful of medications meant to help left him feeling like a zombie, and he gave them up. He was contemplating suicide when he tried MDMA.\n\n\u201cWhen it kicked in, it was like an epiphany,\u201d he said. \u201cI could see all these things from combat I was afraid to look at before, and I had a totally new perspective. I relived the parts of me I had lost. I realized I had viewed myself as a monster, and I was able to start to have some compassion for myself. It was a turning point, and for the next year I continued to get better.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/02/us/02ecstasy-1-print/00mdma-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/02/us/02ecstasy-1-print/merlin_137271105_0141e5d4-25bb-4bda-9187-246332ceeda7-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/02/us/02ecstasy-1-print/00mdma-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Philipps"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/ecstasy-molly-ptsd-mdma.html", "title": "Ecstasy as a Remedy for PTSD?
