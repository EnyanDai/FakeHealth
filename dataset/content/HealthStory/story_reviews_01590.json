The process is also known as injection lipolysis, lipozap, lipotherapy, and mesotherapy.\n\nReality: Though it's easier than eating right and exercising, the products used to perform the procedure are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fat removal and the agency has issued a consumer warning about false and misleading claims, said Dr. Janet Woodcock director of FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.\n\nMoreover, the FDA says it's \"not aware\" of clinical studies showing lipodissolve is effective or safe. Unexpected side effects include permanent scarring, skin deformation, and deep, painful knots under the skin in areas where the lipodissolve treatments were injected according to the FDA.\n\nThe drugs most regularly used in the lipodissolve injection regimen are phosphatidylcholine (PC) and deoxycholate (DC). Other ingredients may also be used, including drugs or components of other products such as vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts.\n\nEarlier this week, the FDA announced it had sent warning lettersto six medical spas in the United States\u2014and a cyber letter to a company in Brazil\u2014for making false or misleading statements on their Web sites about drugs used in the procedure. For example, some of the companies have made claims that lipodissolve is superior to liposuction or that it can be used to treat certain medical conditions, such as male breast enlargement, benign fatty growths known as lipomas, excess fat deposits and surgical deformities.\n\nThe following U.S. companies received warning letters:\n\nMonarch Med Spa, King of Prussia, Pa.\n\nSpa 35, Boise, Idaho\n\nMedical Cosmetic Enhancements, Chevy Chase, Md.\n\nInnovative Directions in Health, Edina, Minn.\n\nPURE Med Spa, Boca Raton, Fla.\n\nAll About You Med Spa, Madison, Ind.\n\nThe Brazilian firm getting a warning letter marketed lipodissolve products on two no-longer functioning Web sites: zipmed.net and mesoone.com.\n\nTo report a side effect, go to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting Program\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/graphic/2008-12/43829610.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/graphic/2009-06/46895467.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://extras.chicagotribune.com/blogs/rssfeed.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/.a/6a00d834518cc969e201347fc29666970c-320wi", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-fcYWUmj5YbYKM.gif?tags=typepad.extended", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/.shared/images/spinner.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/11/16/julie_headshot_2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.ftjcfx.com/image-3250439-10562310", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/thumbnails/teaser/2008-04/37852116-14115326.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://s9.addthis.com/button1-share.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.chicagotribune.com/images/ct_small_blog.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/graphic/2009-06/47679579.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/trb.chicagotribune/feature/lifestyle/health/blog;dcopt=ist;ptype=s;tile=1;sz=728x90;ord=123456789", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/trb.chicagotribune/feature/lifestyle/health/blog;ptype=s;tile=1;sz=300x250;ord=123456789", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/thumbnails/teaser/2008-12/43829590-11151848.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://www.chicagotribune.com/media/alternatethumbnails/teaser/2008-12/43829590-11151835.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20100411212824im_/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/.a/6a00d834518cc969e201347fc29666970c-320wi", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Name Is Required To Post A Comment"], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Julie's Health Club: Health claim: Weight loss shot dissolves fat", "meta_data": {"generator": "http://www.typepad.com/", "keywords": "lipodissolve, obesity, weight loss", "description": "Part of an ongoing series looking at the reality behind health claims.
