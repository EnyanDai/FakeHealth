REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi\n\nTheir findings, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, also provide some new insights into the development of days-old embryos, such as how babies inherit some genes from the mother and some from the father.\n\nThey said the new test could help fertility clinics pick the best embryo to implant in the womb.\n\nThis would save mothers from having several treatments and help improve on the current method of implanting multiple embryos to try to get one pregnancy and risk multiple births in the process.\n\n\u201cOur results shed light on human embryo development,\u201d wrote Renee Reijo Pera of Stanford University in California and colleagues. \u201cOur methods and algorithms may provide an approach for early diagnosis of embryo potential in assisted reproduction.\u201d\n\nSo called test-tube babies are conceived by uniting egg and sperm in a lab dish and transferring the embryo into a woman\u2019s uterus to develop. Most do not develop properly and labs have been looking for ways to improve their success rate.\n\nAlthough it is not recommended, some IVF clinics will implant more than one embryo into the mother\u2019s womb \u2014 leading to the birth of triplets, quadruplets and even more. Such babies almost always are born too early and face lifelong health problems.\n\nAll pregnancies are tenuous, even those achieved the old fashioned way. The March of Dimes, a charity founded to battle birth defects, estimates that as many as 50 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage \u2014 most often before a woman knows she is pregnant.\n\nFor the new test the researchers watched embryos divide and develop from the time sperm met egg in a lab dish. As the embryos split and grew, they also tested gene expression \u2014 looking at which genes activated, and when.\n\nTo their surprise, they found that almost from the very beginning some of the handful of cells had different sets of active genes.\n\nAn embryo\u2019s fate \u2014 whether it would develop normally or not \u2014 seemed determined in many cases from the moment of conception and relied heavily on the mother\u2019s egg cell, they found.\n\nEmbryos most likely to form a ball of cells called a blastocyst developed at a certain, measurable rate, they found.\n\nAuxogyn, Inc., a privately held medical technology company, said in a statement it had acquired an exclusive license from Stanford University to develop products related to the findings.\n\n\u201cBlastocyst formation is a critical time point in human embryo development and provides more objective criteria for selecting which embryo(s) to transfer,\u201d Lissa Goldenstein, president and CEO of Auxogyn, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cFor years, researchers have searched for ways to predict the embryos most likely to reach the blastocyst stage in order to enable earlier transfer and ultimately improve live birth rates for in vitro fertilization procedures.\u201d\n\nThe company estimates that there are 500 clinics in the United States providing in vitro fertilization or IVF services, with combined annual revenues of nearly $2 billion.", "images": ["http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101004&t=2&i=218149620&r=2010-10-04T121150Z_01_BTRE6930XVT00_RTROPTP_0_ITALY&w=20",
