It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.\n\nInfants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.\n\nResearchers used magnetic resonance imaging \u2014 or MRI \u2014 to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.\n\nOn the right, MRI of a baby at 6 months who was diagnosed with autism at 2 years. The dark space between the brain folds and skull indicate increased amounts of cerebrospinal fluid. On the left: MRI of a baby who was not diagnosed with autism at age 2. Note the decreased amount of CSF. UNC Health Care / UNC School of Medicine\n\nThis excess fluid \u201ccould possibly be an early biological marker for autism,\u201d said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.\n\nRelated: See the special bond between a boy with autism and a deaf shelter dog\n\nThe study results are \u201cvery exciting,\u201d said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. \u201cYou can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.\u201d\n\nShen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could \u201champer brain development\u201d and lead to autism, said Shen.\n\nCompletely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.\n\nRelated: De Niro says 'find the truth on vaccines'. But scientists already did\n\nParents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain MRIs for younger siblings, Shen said.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t recommend that every high-risk infant get an MRI until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the 90 percent range\u201d from the current 70 percent, Shen told TODAY.\n\nHe and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brain\u2019s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,\u201d said Shen.\n\nAbout 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.", "images":
