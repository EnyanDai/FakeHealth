In most cases, the lump or lesion is benign or noncancerous and does not require further treatment.\n\nBiopsies may be performed via open surgery on the breast or with a less invasive core-needle biopsy in which a small sample of breast tissue from the affected area is removed through a special needle inserted through the skin.\n\nResearchers say needle biopsy has fewer complications and a shorter recovery time than open surgical biopsy, but some women and doctors may have concerns about the accuracy of the procedure compared with traditional open surgery methods of breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nIn the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers reviewed 83 studies on the two methods.\n\nThe results showed that core needle biopsies were about as accurate as open surgery at detecting cancerous vs. noncancerous breast lesions.\n\nNeedle biopsies also had a much lower rate of complications (less than 1% compared with 2%-10% with open surgery).\n\nIn addition, the study showed women initially diagnosed with breast cancer with needle biopsy were more likely to be treated with a single breast cancer surgery than those initially diagnosed by open surgical biopsy.\n\n\"Based on currently available evidence, it appears reasonable to substitute core needle biopsy procedures for open surgical biopsy given the comparable sensitivity and lower complication rates,\" write researcher Wendy Bruening, PhD, of the ECRI Institute Evidence-Based Practices Center in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and colleagues. They say additional studies are needed to find out what factors affect the accuracy of core-needle breast biopsy.", "images":
