Studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzyme\u2019s activity dramatically reduces production of beta-amyloid peptides, which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms -- including memory loss -- associated with Alzheimer's.\n\nBy using BACE1 inhibitors to gradually lower the enzyme's levels, researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice, offering hope for human subjects down the line, according to the study.\n\nCleveland Clinic Lerner Research via Journal of Experimental Medicine\n\nHowever, researchers urge caution with the results as many Alzheimer\u2019s discoveries seem to hold true in mice, then fail in people.\n\nCleveland Clinic researcher Riqiang Yan, Ph.D., an author on the study, told ABC News that in the mouse model, the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted, completely stopping the enzyme's production. But in humans, it\u2019s unlikely that BACE1 inhibitors would totally halt the enzyme's production, Yan said.\n\nNonetheless, five BACE1 inhibitors are being tested in human subjects currently, Yan added.\n\n\u201cBACE1 inhibitors are still hopeful for AD patients if they have no unwanted side effects or can be tolerated for long-term use,\u201d Yan said.\n\nYan added researchers are currently in phase II and, in some cases, phase III clinical trials for the various compounds.\n\nDr. Jay-Sheree Allen is a family medicine resident physician at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and a resident at the ABC News Medical Unit.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/cleveland-clinic-lerner-research-gty-ps-180215_16x9_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/alzheimers-study-cleveland-ho-ps-180215_33x16_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/cleveland-clinic-lerner-research-gty-ps-180215_12x5_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/cleveland-clinic-lerner-research-gty-ps-180215_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Dr. Jay-Sheree Allen"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/alzheimers-disease-reversed-mice-offering-hope-humans-research/story?id=53114260", "title": "Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice, offering hope for humans, new research shows", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Amyloid plaques largely disappeared with the deletion of just a single enzyme.", "keywords": "alzheimer's, research, hope, trial, mice,health news, medical news, medical articles", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2018-02-15T14:10:29:886-08", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice, offering hope for humans, new research shows", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice, offering hope for humans, new research shows", "description": "Amyloid plaques largely disappeared with the deletion of just a single enzyme.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/alzheimers-disease-reversed-mice-offering-hope-humans-research/story?id=53114260", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/cleveland-clinic-lerner-research-gty-ps-180215_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "alzheimer's, research, hope, trial, mice", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "Alzheimer's disease reversed in mice, offering hope for humans, new research shows", "description": "Amyloid plaques largely disappeared with the deletion of just a single enzyme.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/alzheimers-disease-reversed-mice-offering-hope-humans-research/story?id=53114260", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/cleveland-clinic-lerner-research-gty-ps-180215_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,53114260", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,53114260", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/alzheimers-disease-reversed-mice-offering-hope-humans-research/story?id=53114260"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,53114260", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,53114260", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/alzheimers-disease-reversed-mice-offering-hope-humans-research/story?id=53114260", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/alzheimers-disease-reversed-mice-offering-hope-humans-research/story?id=53114260"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
