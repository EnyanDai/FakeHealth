The condition \u2013 which people develop as they age \u2013 involves issues with thinking and memory. It affects more than 6 percent of people in their 60s, and it increases to 37 percent for those age 85 and older.\n\nAmong the guidelines:\n\nDoctors should tell people with mild cognitive impairment to exercise consistently, as six-month studies have indicated exercising twice a week could improve memory.\n\nMedical professionals can suggest cognitive training for people, though the evidence isn't strong that this could be beneficial for improvement.\n\nMild cognitive impairment should not be confused with dementia \u2013 mild cognitive impairment comes with milder symptoms \u2013 though evidence has shown it can escalate to that point. Those with dementia may have trouble with daily tasks like getting dressed and making meals, but with mild cognitive impairment, people tend to have more difficulty than others their age remembering things like appointments or where they keep their car keys, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nThe guidelines note that no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications exist for mild cognitive impairment treatment, nor are high-quality, long-term studies in the works that imply drugs or dietary changes could aid people who have the condition.", "images": ["https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b1f9078/2147483647/thumbnail/640x420/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F31%2F0d%2F8835d59d460492a91da46413081d%2F150325-manwindow-stock.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/a04fb91/2147483647/crop/2700x2700%2B0%2B469/resize/84x84/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa4%2F45%2F0dbb94f44fed8d5c3e531100def9%2Fdavid-oliver.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/418eea9/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2F7c%2Fa9774d7f410785fa055cf06a6ffd%2F140707-seniorsexercise-stock.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/static/img/usn-logo-large.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/418eea9/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2F7c%2Fa9774d7f410785fa055cf06a6ffd%2F140707-seniorsexercise-stock.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://health.usnews.com/wellness/health-buzz/articles/2017-12-29/research-mild-cognitive-impairment-patients-should-exercise-twice-a-week", "title": "Research: Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients Should Exercise Twice a Week", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Benefits of exercise to general health are well known.
