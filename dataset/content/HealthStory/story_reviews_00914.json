Men\u2019s leg hair had successfully been transplanted before to the back of the head, but these are believed to be the first documented cases of leg hair being used to restore the hairline.\n\nThe procedure has the potential to restore the hairlines of millions of men with male pattern baldness, the most common cause of hair loss and often an enormous source of stress. The condition, also called androgenic alopecia, typically begins at the hairline and eventually creates a horseshoe-shaped pattern of hair around the ears. It stems from a sensitivity \u2014 largely genetic \u2014 to the effects of hormones on hair follicles.\n\nIn traditional transplants, hair follicles are taken from an area that runs an inch or two above the ears and temples to the back of the head. Dermatologists can transplant follicles from this area \u2013 called the safe donor zone because hair follicles there are impervious to the hormones that cause hair loss \u2013 to the front of the head without worrying that the hair that grows from them will fall out. But hair that comes from the back of the head is typically much coarser than the fine hair that grows in front.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a natural hairline, it\u2019s very soft, like baby hair,\u201d said Dr. Sanusi Umar, an associate instructor of dermatology at the medical school of the University of California, Los Angeles, and author of the new report. \u201cThe back of the head is where you find the thickest hair on the head. If you take that hair and use it in the hairline, it can end up looking harsh and pluggy, because the hair is too thick.\u201d\n\nDr. Umar was inspired to develop the procedure in part from personal experience. In 1996, as a medical internist with thinning hair, he underwent a traditional hair transplant procedure but was unhappy with the results. \u201cThat inspired me to go into dermatology,\u201d he said. After reading a 2008 report showing it was possible for transplanted leg hair to survive and grow naturally on the back of a man\u2019s head, Dr. Umar realized its potential to create softer, more natural-looking hairlines. \u201cIf you transplant leg hair on the head, it\u2019s not going to start acting like head hair. It will still grow shorter and slower than scalp hair,\u201d he said.\n\nAt his clinic in Redondo Beach, Calif., Dr. Umar tried the technique on two patients, one a 35-year-old man who was embarrassed by the results of a traditional hair transplant to restore his hairline. \u201cHe was self-conscious about the problem and resorted to styling his hair forward to obscure the hairline,\u201d Dr. Umar wrote in his report. The other patient, a 29-year-old man who had also undergone a traditional transplant, was likewise \u201cunhappy about his hairline, which he felt was too harsh and straight,\u201d Dr. Umar wrote. \u201cHe had resorted to cropping his hair short to obscure the problem.\u201d\n\nWith the patients under local anesthesia, Dr. Umar used a device that creates microscopic wounds around hair follicles in the back of the leg; the follicles were then removed and transplanted to the hairline. The hairs were removed in a diffuse pattern, so there were no bald spots on the legs after the procedure. \u201cBecause these are very tiny wounds, they heal and close up with minimal scarring,\u201d he said.\n\nIn each case, Dr. Umar and his team extracted about 1,000 leg hair follicles and grafted them, one by one, to the patients\u2019 hairlines. About 75 to 80 percent of the transplanted leg hair grew successfully on the patients\u2019 heads after the operations, and both men were happy with the results, Dr. Umar said. \u201cThe hairline was fully grown and soft-looking by nine months\u201d in the 35-year-old, he wrote, \u201cat which time the patient started combing his hair backward and sporting a ponytail, exposing his hairline comfortably.\u201d\n\nSince then, Dr. Umar has done eight more of the procedures, including one in a woman. On average, a procedure involves 1,500 to 1,800 follicles and takes about eight hours, with breaks.\n\nA lot of these patients \u201chave no other options or alternatives,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve been told to forget about it by many other clinics. It\u2019s life-altering for them when they realize that this is possible.\u201d", "images":
