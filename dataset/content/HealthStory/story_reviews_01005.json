Researchers then analyzed health status information collected after the women turned 70.\n\nAfter taking into account other factors that might affect health and disease risk, like smoking, researchers found women who drank light or moderate amounts of alcohol were less likely to develop chronic diseases as they aged.\n\nFor example, compared to nondrinkers, women who drank up to one alcoholic drink per day were 20% more likely to be disease-free at age 70 than nondrinkers.", "images":
