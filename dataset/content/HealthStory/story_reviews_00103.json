The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.\n\nPatients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn\u2019t require cutting open the chest.\n\nAfterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.\n\nIn addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.\n\nThe results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke\u2019s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n\u201cThese symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient\u2019s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,\u201d Cohen, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email.\n\n\u201cBy replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her \u2018normal\u2019 quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,\u201d Cohen said by email.\n\nOverall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.\n\nParticipants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.\n\nThe smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.\n\nOne limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing. Straiton didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve.\n\nSurgeons may also perform what\u2019s known as angioplasty, which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve; sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent, or tiny wire mesh cage, to keep the artery propped open.\n\nResults of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\n\u201cReplacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity,\u201d Kapadia, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said by email. \u201cTranscatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2EMHTuH Age and Ageing, online January 25, 2018.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Rapaport", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-heart-tavr-idUSKCN1G72DT", "title": "Less-invasive heart valve replacement tied to better quality of life", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
