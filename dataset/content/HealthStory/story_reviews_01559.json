But only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes like heart disease, stroke or emphysema.\n\nSeparately, Italian researchers reported that advanced lung cancer patients given the targeted therapy drug Tarceva as so-called maintenance treatment \u2014 after they finished a course of standard chemotherapy \u2014 lived a little bit longer.\n\nFederico Cappuzzo from Ospedale Civile di Livorno in Italy and colleagues did a phase 3 trial in 889 patients who had already had chemotherapy and whose tumors had not come back.\n\nThey received either Tarceva, a drug sold by Roche and OSI Pharmaceuticals and known generically as erlotinib, or a placebo until they got worse or died.\n\nThe patients who got Tarceva lived a little longer without their tumors growing \u2014 12 weeks versus 11 weeks on average and they lived a month longer on average \u2014 12 months versus 11 months.\n\nThis was seen even among patients who did not have the EGFR genetic mutation that Tarceva targets, they reported in Lancet Oncology.\n\nFewer than half of all lung cancer patients who do well after a first course of chemotherapy get more treatment, but the Italian group said their study shows this is worth doing.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Fox", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-lung-idUSTRE64H5MR20100518", "title": "Drug may prevent lung cancer, study finds", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "A drug approved to treat a range of conditions may also work to prevent lung cancer in people who have given up smoking, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.", "Author": "Maggie Fox", "keywords": "Italy,United States,Cynthia Osterman,Julie Steenhuysen,Stacey Joyce,Federico Cappuzzo,Maggie Fox,Robert Keith,US,CANCER,LUNG", "news_keywords": "Italy;United States;Cynthia Osterman;Julie Steenhuysen;Stacey Joyce;Federico Cappuzzo;Maggie Fox;Robert Keith;US;CANCER;LUNG", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue May 18 22:56:47 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-05-18T22:56:47+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Maggie Fox", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-lung-idUSTRE64H5MR20100518", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Drug may prevent lung cancer, study finds", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Italy,United States,Cynthia Osterman,Julie Steenhuysen,Stacey Joyce,Federico Cappuzzo,Maggie Fox,Robert Keith,US,CANCER,LUNG", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-LUNG", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Drug may prevent lung cancer, study finds", "sailthru.author": "Maggie Fox", "sailthru.date": "2010-05-18T22:56:47+0000", "sailthru.title": "Drug may prevent lung cancer, study finds", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Drug may prevent lung cancer, study finds", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-lung-idUSTRE64H5MR20100518", "type": "article", "description": "A drug approved to treat a range of conditions may also work to prevent lung can...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-05-18T22:56:47+0000", "modified_time": "2010-05-18T22:56:47+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Maggie Fox", "tag": "Italy,United States,Cynthia Osterman,Julie Steenhuysen,Stacey Joyce,Federico Cappuzzo,Maggie Fox,Robert Keith,US,CANCER,LUNG"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Drug may prevent lung cancer, study finds", "description": "A drug approved to treat a range of conditions may also work to prevent lung cancer in people who have given up smoking, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
