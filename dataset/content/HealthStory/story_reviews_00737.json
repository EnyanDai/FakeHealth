That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs.\n\nIn an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested.\n\nIn this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50.\n\nThe panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there\u2019s no recommendation for men of any age.\n\nDespite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011.\n\n\u2018INCIDENTALOPOROSIS?\u2019\n\nFor the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs.\n\nOverall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs.\n\nThe researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used.\n\nDr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit \u201cincidentaloporosis\u201d - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses \u201cdiscovered\u201d while doctors were looking for something else.\n\nAt the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed.\n\nPickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that\u2019s suitable for diagnosis you wouldn\u2019t run that risk,\u201d he said.\n\nCT v. DXA\n\nMajumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don\u2019t include the hip - like a DXA would.\n\nA DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500. Both involve radiation.\n\nDr. Beatrice Hull, from the Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Health at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told Reuters Health that she\u2019d want her patients to have a DXA scan even with a diagnosis from a CT scan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think at this point this one test is going to prevent further testing. I think it will identify patients who are at a higher risk and need more testing,\u201d said Hull, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/Zwi3u5 Annals of Internal Medicine, online April 15, 2013.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew M.
