It significantly raises the risk of stroke.\n\nPatients in the Medtronic-sponsored trial who underwent the cryoablation procedure \u2014 which involves using a catheter to freeze away the heart tissue where the problem originates \u2014 was just as safe as drugs used to treat the condition and far more effective, meeting the study\u2019s primary goal of eliminating atrial fibrillation one year after the procedure.\n\nDubbed Stop-af, the Medtronic trial showed that almost 70 percent of patients who had cryoablation remained free of the condition after one year, compared with just 7 percent of patients who received drug therapy, according to data presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThis is the best data we have at this point in support of cryoablation (to treat atrial fibrillation),\u201d said Dr. Douglas Packer of Mayo Clinic, the lead investigator of the study.\n\nOver 3 percent of patients treated by cryoablation experienced a serious condition \u2014 a narrowing of the pulmonary vein in 7 out of 228 patients, one of whom required another procedure to widen the vein.\n\nDamage or irritation to the nerve that controls the diaphragm was reported in 11 percent of the cryoablation procedures, but none of the cases was considered serious, with 98 percent resolved by the 12-month follow-up.\n\nComplications related to the atrial fibrillation itself were also monitored. During the follow-up period, 97 percent of patients who got the procedure and 92 percent of the drug therapy patients did not suffer heart attack, stroke or death.\n\nLess than 1 percent of patients treated with cryoablation were hospitalized for a recurrence of the disease, compared with 6 percent in the drug group.\n\nPatients in the pilot study had advanced atrial fibrillation and tended to have other medical problems, such as high blood pressure, diabetes or coronary artery disease,\n\nPacker, who also led the pilot study, dubbed Cabana, acknowledged that the main limitation of this study was its small size, but said it lays the foundation for a larger one.\n\nHe said the larger study, which will include 180 centers, is currently enrolling patients.\n\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs eliminate atrial fibrillation in about half of all patients but can have adverse side effects.\n\nCryoablation is an alternative that is growing in popularity. Over the past decade, more patients have been referred for ablation procedures when drugs proved ineffective.\n\nCatheter ablation involves inserting a thin tube into a blood vessel, usually through a site in the upper leg or neck, and then threading it though the body until it reaches the heart. When it reaches the area of the heart that causes abnormal rhythms, the tissue is ablated, or destroyed.\n\nThe procedure has been used to treat arrhythmias for years. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration initially cleared ablation catheters to treat arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter, but not atrial fibrillation.\n\nOnly Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has an ablation device approved by U.S. health regulators specifically to treat atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe Medtronic device, which the company added to its portfolio with the 2008 acquisition of CryoCath, has been approved in Europe and Australia.\n\nMedtronic shares were up 3.7 percent to $45.55 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Debra Sherman", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-medtronic-afib-idUSTRE62E3M420100315", "title": "Medtronic atrial fibrillation system shines in study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "globalMarketsNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;globalMarketsNews", "description": "A noninvasive procedure that freezes and kills problem-causing heart tissue was nearly 10 times better at eliminating a potentially serious heart rhythm disorder than conventional anti-arrhythmic drugs, researchers said on Monday.", "Author": "Debra Sherman", "keywords": "US,HEART,MEDTRONIC,AFIB", "news_keywords": "US;HEART;MEDTRONIC;AFIB", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Mar 15 16:43:36 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-03-15T16:43:36+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Debra Sherman", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-medtronic-afib-idUSTRE62E3M420100315", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Medtronic atrial fibrillation system shines in study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,HEART,MEDTRONIC,AFIB", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEART-MEDTRONIC-AFIB", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Medtronic atrial fibrillation system shines in study", "sailthru.author": "Debra Sherman", "sailthru.date": "2010-03-15T16:43:36+0000", "sailthru.title": "Medtronic atrial fibrillation system shines in study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Medtronic atrial fibrillation system shines in study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-heart-medtronic-afib-idUSTRE62E3M420100315", "type": "article", "description": "A noninvasive procedure that freezes and kills problem-causing heart tissue was ...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-03-15T16:43:36+0000", "modified_time": "2010-03-15T16:43:36+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Debra Sherman", "tag": "US,HEART,MEDTRONIC,AFIB"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Medtronic atrial fibrillation system shines in study", "description": "A noninvasive procedure that freezes and kills problem-causing heart tissue was nearly 10 times better at eliminating a potentially serious heart rhythm disorder than conventional anti-arrhythmic drug...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1268671416.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
