REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nThe Swiss drugmaker\u2019s BYL719, a so-called PI3K inhibitor also known as alpelisib, combined with hormone therapy fulvestrant boosted median progression-free survival (PFS) to 11 months, up from 5.7 months for patients who got only hormone therapy, the company said on Saturday.\n\nBYL719 plus fulvestrant cut risk of death or progression in those patients by an estimated 35 percent, Novartis said.\n\nNovartis said earlier this year that this study, called SOLAR-1, of hormone receptor positive, HER2- breast cancer with mutations of the PIK3CA gene showed that YL719 helped patients.\n\nBut this specific benefit data is being released on Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology\u2019s annual conference in Munich.\n\nEven though PIK3CA mutations are the most common genetic change in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, trials of agents seeking to put a brake on this pathway to tumor growth have largely disappointed including on safety issues.\n\nOther drugmakers including Roche have seen similar investigational medicines stumble, making Novartis\u2019s progress here hopeful news, doctors involved in the trial said.\n\n\u201cThe results of SOLAR-1 are the most encouraging observed to date from a trial evaluating a PI3K inhibitor\u201d for patients with this kind of breast cancer, said Fabrice Andre, a professor at France\u2019s Institut Gustave Roussy.\n\n\u201cThese data have the potential to allow physicians to address an unmet need in this patient population by using a biomarker-driven treatment to inform their sequencing decisions,\u201d Andre added.\n\nLike other companies, Novartis is seeking to personalize treatment for cancer patients by using biomarkers like those showing PIK3CA gene mutations to help guide treatment.\n\nTALKS WITH REGULATORS\n\nThis week, Novartis signed a deal to have Roche unit Foundation Medicine provide genomic profiling of patient samples taken from Novartis\u2019 clinical oncology trials. Other cancer drugmakers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck also have Foundation deals.\n\nSamit Hirawat, head of Novartis\u2019s cancer drug development, said in an interview the side-effects profile of alpelisib held up.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see as much diarrhea, we do not have CNS (central nervous system) side effects, we do not have the liver effects,\u201d he said.\n\nNovartis plans to file with regulators for approval of the drug this year, Hirawat said, adding he also has strategies to broaden the indication, including tough-to-treat triple-negative breast cancer.\n\n\u201cPIK3CA mutations are present in many other tumor types,\u201d Hirawat said. \u201cThere is a larger program we are putting into place.\u201d", "images":
