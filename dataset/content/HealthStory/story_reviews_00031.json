According to the National Center for Health Statistics, an estimated 25.3 million Americans, or 11.2 percent of U.S. adults, experience chronic pain. It can interfere with work and home life and leave patients debilitated, disabled and depressed. So it makes sense that Jay jumped at the chance to experience long-term pain relief with the help of a spinal-cord stimulator.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJay lays out the hows and whys of spinal stimulation, and she paints a vivid picture of a life in agony, a journey that has included skeptical doctors, plenty of painkillers and unanswered questions about the future.\n\nShe also describes her path to spinal stimulation, how the device works with the body to short-circuit pain, and the many roadblocks to relief that patients face.\n\n\u201cEven for me, the battle is not over,\u201d Jay writes. \u201cSince this surgery I\u2019ve actually had another disc herniate, complicating everything. My spine isn\u2019t cured, and I still hurt all the time. But the pain is far more controlled, and I can function much better at my current level of discomfort.\u201d\n\nAs the human and financial costs of the opioid crisis rise, spinal stimulation may become more popular, even though it\u2019s expensive. Jay says she was lucky: Her insurance covered much of the six-figure bill for the procedure.\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x46kel4QEWiM2UeEwGDU64k53RE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BVP2Q4FXTQI6RFHLHPKS37URPM.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D5fm1kLBCBOyr5dPCdWV7k8buc0=/150x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BVP2Q4FXTQI6RFHLHPKS37URPM.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x46kel4QEWiM2UeEwGDU64k53RE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BVP2Q4FXTQI6RFHLHPKS37URPM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Blakemore"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/heres-how-one-woman-used-an-implant-to-get-some-relief-from-chronic-back-pain/2018/09/14/fa975bc8-b603-11e8-a7b5-adaaa5b2a57f_story.html", "title": "Here\u2019s how one woman used an implant to get some relief from chronic back pain", "meta_data": {"description": "Janet Jay describes how she \u201cbecame a cyborg\u201d using a spinal cord stimulator.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/heres-how-one-woman-used-an-implant-to-get-some-relief-from-chronic-back-pain/2018/09/14/fa975bc8-b603-11e8-a7b5-adaaa5b2a57f_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/x46kel4QEWiM2UeEwGDU64k53RE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BVP2Q4FXTQI6RFHLHPKS37URPM.jpg", "title": "Here\u2019s how one woman used an implant to get some relief from chronic back pain", "description": "Janet Jay describes how she \u201cbecame a cyborg\u201d using a spinal cord stimulator."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Here\u2019s how one woman used an implant to get some relief from chronic back pain", "description": "Janet Jay describes how she \u201cbecame a cyborg\u201d using a spinal cord stimulator."}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536897600.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
