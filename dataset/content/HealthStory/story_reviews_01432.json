But a new study shows that people older than age of 70 had good results after arthroscopic surgery of their rotator cuff tears.\n\nThe study, published recently online in Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, looked at results two years after surgery among 39 people age 70 and older who had a full-thickness tear in their rotator cuff. The participants had already gone through more conservative treatment such as taking pain medication or undergoing a debridement, a procedure that removes dead or damaged tissue or foreign matter from an injured area.\n\nOverall it was good news for patients afte rthe minimally invasive surgery: About 96% experienced significant pain reduction, and of the seven who were working before surgery, all returned to their jobs at pre-surgery levels.\n\nGenerally, range of motion improved substantially, as did muscle strength. The vast majority of patients said function had improved in their shoulders, and 94% said if they had to do it all over again they\u2019d still have the surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn people over the age of 70, pain is the main issue, and pain relief is a fairly reliable outcome after surgery,\u201d said Dr. Nikhil Verma, the study\u2019s lead author, in a news release. Verma is an orthopedic surgeon at Rush Medical College in Chicago.\n\n-- Jeannine Stein / Los Angeles Times", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-sep-01-la-heb-rotator-cuff-20100901-story.html", "title": "Arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery might benefit older people, study finds", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery might benefit older people, study finds", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-sep-01-la-heb-rotator-cuff-20100901-story.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "lat-logo-dark-full.jpg"}, "description": "Arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery might benefit older people, study finds", "site_name": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "published_time": "2010-09-01T07:00:00", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery might benefit older people, study finds", "site": "@latimes", "title": "Arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery might benefit older people, study finds"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119932621434123, "pages": 5863113009}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "description": "Arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery might benefit older people, study finds", "brightspot.contentId": "00000169-988e-d37a-a1ff-9ccf373c0000", "brightspot.cached": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1283338800.0, "source": "http://www.latimes.com", "summary": ""}
