The older people tended to have more activity in several inflammation-related genes compared with the younger group \u2014 no surprise, since as people get older, inflammation throughout the body tends to rise. Chronic diseases of aging, like diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, cancer, joint disorders and Alzheimer\u2019s, are all believed to have inflammation in common. \u201cMost of the diseases of aging are not really diseases of aging, per se, but rather diseases of inflammation,\u201d Furman says. The more active these genes were, the more likely the person was to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even among older people, those with lower levels of these factors were more protected against inflammation \u2014 and they had something else in common too. They all drank caffeine regularly. People who drank more than five cups of coffee a day showed extremely low levels of activity in the inflammatory gene pathway. Caffeine inhibits this circuit and turns the inflammatory pathway off, the researchers say.\n\nThe goal isn\u2019t to make every trace of inflammation disappear, the scientists stress. In fact, inflammation is an important function of the immune system, which uses it to fight off infections and remove potentially toxic compounds. But with aging, the process isn\u2019t regulated as well as it is in a younger body. \u201cClearly in aging something is breaking down, and we become less effective at managing this inflammation,\u201d says Mark Davis, director of the Stanford institute. \u201cBut now in this paper, we identify a particular pathway that was not associated with inflammation before. We are able to point, with a much higher resolution picture, at aging and the things that should be markers for inflammation.\u201d\n\nThe key will be to figure out when the inflammatory response starts to spiral out of control. In an upcoming study, Furman and others will soon investigate the immune systems of 1,000 people; he hopes to use that information to develop a reference range of immune-system components to tell people whether their levels are normal, or if they\u2019re at higher risk for developing chronic conditions driven by inflammation.\n\nIn the meantime, following the example of caffeine-drinking adults with lower levels of inflammation \u2014 by having a cup of joe or two \u2014 might be a good idea.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/brain-mathematics-special-education-02-1.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/milligan2.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/50-healthiest-foods-coffee.gif?w=667&h=628&crop=1", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/50-healthiest-foods-coffee.gif?w=667&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alice Park"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4634553/is-coffee-bad-aging-caffeine/", "title": "Is Coffee Bad?
