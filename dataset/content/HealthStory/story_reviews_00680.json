Federal regulators require companies to conduct studies proving the effectiveness of such therapies, and monitor them closely. The practice is common for smoking cessation therapies, said Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, who was among the study\u2019s authors. If such studies were funded by the government, which sustains a lot of academic research, taxpayers would bear the burden for what the company would eventually profit from, he said.\n\nStill, some researchers not involved in the study said the topic required more work.\n\n\u201cThe approach taken here is a very reasonable one that appears to have been successful,\u201d said Gary A. Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the State University of New York at Buffalo. \u201cBut the findings from one study do not make a fact. We need more studies, funded by someone other than the company that makes the product.\u201d\n\nSmoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans a year. The smoking rate has declined substantially since the 1960s, but the pace of decline has slowed in recent years and health experts are trying to figure out how to get more smokers to quit.\n\nAbout 1,500 patients at 61 clinics in the United States and abroad participated in the study. None were willing to quit immediately, but all said they wanted to smoke less and to quit for good within three months. They were randomly assigned to two groups. One got Chantix, the brand name of the drug varenicline, which is taken twice a day by mouth as a pill; the other group got a placebo.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/science/18smoking/18smoking-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/science/18smoking/18smoking-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/science/18smoking/18smoking-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sabrina Tavernise"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/health/pills-found-to-help-chances-of-quitting-smoking-in-the-future.html", "title": "Medicine Given Even Before Smokers Are Ready to Quit Is Found to Help Them", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-02-17T16:01:57.000Z", "modified": "2015-02-17T16:01:47.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/sabrina-tavernise", "tag": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003509967, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/20191b93-1818-5802-a7c7-11fd75975706", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/963615d001a14652840865cd329ddb6a", "description": "A study has found that even for people who are not ready to stop smoking immediately, medicine taken over time can improve their chances of eventually quitting.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/science/18smoking/18smoking-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Sabrina Tavernise", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/science/18smoking/18smoking-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Smoking,,Journal of the American Medical Assn,Nicotine,Pfizer,,Pharmaceuticals", "pdate": 20150217, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/health/pills-found-to-help-chances-of-quitting-smoking-in-the-future.html", "type": "article", "title": "Medicine Given Even Before Smokers Are Ready to Quit Is Found to Help Them", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/science/18smoking/18smoking-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Smokers brave the cold for a quick cigarette in Manhattan.
