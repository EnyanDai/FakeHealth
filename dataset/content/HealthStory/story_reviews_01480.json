But early last year, the teenager began a type of immunotherapy, eating minute but gradually increasing amounts of milk protein. In March she tasted her first bite of ice cream, the same day she was accepted in the honors business program at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nTraditional immunotherapy, via allergy shots, is a century-old technique most commonly used to treat inhaled allergens \u2014 such as cat dander and pollen \u2014 and it\u2019s also standard treatment for bee sting allergy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsing immunotherapy to treat food allergies is rare and well outside mainstream practice. Cooper\u2019s allergist, Dr. Richard L. Wasserman in Dallas, has treated fewer than 100 food allergy patients \u2014 and he knows of only two other physicians doing it in their practices.\n\nAt the same time, nearly 4% of children in the U.S. had food allergies in 2007, and that number is rising, according to a 2009 article in the journal Pediatrics. These kids and their parents would love to stop scrutinizing food labels and bringing their own meals to potluck suppers.\n\nBut many allergists say immunotherapy for food allergies outside of a research setting is irresponsible. About 20 such trials are now underway, according to the National Institutes of Health database at Clinicaltrials.gov, and that\u2019s where such treatment should currently stay, these allergists say.\n\nThey point out that food-allergy immunotherapy is untested at best, potentially fatal at worst. And several top scientists researching food immunotherapy published an article in the July issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that decried the treatment\u2019s use in patients outside carefully controlled clinical trials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is nowhere near ready for prime time, nowhere near ready to go out to the local allergists,\u201d says Dr. Robert Wood, one of the commentary\u2019s authors and chief of pediatric allergy and immunology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He worries that a food-sensitive patient will die from immunotherapy not performed with sufficient care.\n\nBasic allergy treatment\n\nForty million to 50 million Americans suffer from some sort of allergy, according to a recent report from Harvard Medical School. Most medications \u2014 nasal sprays, antihistamines and the like \u2014 only treat the symptoms, not the underlying sensitivity.\n\nThe only way to diminish allergy is through immunotherapy. Allergists typically provide injections, starting with a tiny bit of what bothers the patient and slowly ramping up to larger amounts.\n\nImmunotherapy does not exactly provide a \u201ccure,\u201d says Dr. Linda Cox, an allergist in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. But it can greatly reduce annoying symptoms. For example, she said, many people come to her practice because they can\u2019t stand more than five minutes in a house with a cat. After immunotherapy, they frequently report they can spend the night in a feline-occupied home. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re necessarily ready to adopt several kittens for their own abode; it just means they\u2019ll need fewer tissues and less Benadryl when Fluffy is nearby.\n\n\u201cNothing works 100% on everybody,\u201d says Dr. Michael Blaiss, an allergist at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. He estimates that 4 in 5 people who get allergy shots reap the benefit.\n\nOnly 5% of eligible allergy sufferers actually sign on for immunotherapy, Cox says, in part because it is quite inconvenient. People need shots weekly or more often \u2014 for weeks or months \u2014 to build up immunity. After that, doctors prescribe three or more years of maintenance shots, roughly monthly, to make sure the effects stick. Each shot requires a doctor\u2019s visit, and patients must wait in the office for half an hour afterward to make sure they don\u2019t have an adverse reaction.\n\nSoon, U.S. patients might be able to get the same therapy in a convenient, take-at-home pill. Recent clinical trials have shown a dissolvable, under-the-tongue tablet to be safe and effective.

The only accepted method for coping with such an allergy is to avoid that particular food \u2014 no easy task when the allergen is as common as milk, wheat or the dreaded peanut.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just constantly afraid; you\u2019re scared of food in general,\u201d says Toni Lacerte of Dallas. Her two daughters used to skip birthday cake and many other foods for fear of peanut contamination. After immunotherapy with Wasserman, fear of food is no longer a problem.\n\n\u201cI really like not knowing what I\u2019m eating,\u201d says Lacerte\u2019s daughter Taylor, 15.\n\nWasserman is among a few allergists bucking the mainstream by offering immunotherapy for food allergy. He presented some of his results this year at a meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in New Orleans. He has now completed the therapy on nearly 60 patients, he says, with 30 more in progress. After several months of treatment, he reports, many of those patients can tolerate one egg or a dozen peanuts.\n\nA victory against a food allergy is challenging because the allergens, such as peanuts, are particularly potent, Blaiss says \u2014 a tiny amount can kill.\n\n\u201cThe obstacle has been trying to do it without causing severe reactions,\u201d Wood says, noting that in a five-subject study of peanut allergy shots more than 10 years ago, all patients suffered serious allergic reactions and one died.\n\nFor that reason, food allergy researchers have switched from attempting to use shots, which put the allergen directly into the bloodstream, to giving the allergen as a food or pill. The approach is much more promising.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2008, Wood and colleagues reported on a study of milk allergy in which they gave 20 allergic children either a slowly escalating dose of milk protein or a placebo. By the end of the treatment, kids in the treatment group could comfortably consume, on average, more than 100 times more milk protein than those in the placebo group could handle. That study was published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\n\nWood has also tried immunotherapy in children sensitive to eggs and peanuts, and some of those kids can now eat as much as they want of the formerly forbidden food. However, he noted, current studies are very small and not everyone gets good results. It remains unclear whether allergies will return in the future. Wood advises that, for now, children should receive this therapy only in a closely supervised research trial.\n\nParents \u201care going to need to be patient while all the details are worked out,\u201d he says.\n\nFears on each side\n\nPatience is a hard sell for parents and children confronting a life-or-death situation with every menu. Waiting, in a sense, can be as risky as treatment.\n\nDelia Cagle, of Richardson, Texas, tears up as she recalls how her son Chad, now 8, had to sit by himself at lunch in kindergarten lest the egg products in other children\u2019s food kill him. When he was quite small, he had a severe reaction after she cooked a casserole containing a bit of mayonnaise, even though she washed her hands before preparing Chad\u2019s egg-free meal.\n\n\u201cHe turned blue and went limp in my arms,\u201d Cagle recalls.\n\nTo end that fear, the Cagles chose to trust Wasserman and put Chad in immunotherapy.\n\nWasserman maintains that it\u2019s better to actively treat food allergies than to simply hope that kids don\u2019t encounter their allergen when far from home.\n\nDelia Cagle, for one, agrees. \u201cI feel like it is so much safer,\u201d she says of her son\u2019s life post-treatment. She no longer fears Chad will die after an accidental brush with egg. In fact, he now eats two eggs every day to keep up his resistance.\n\nBut a dozen or so of Wasserman\u2019s patients dropped out of the therapy \u2014 some because they didn\u2019t like the food, and others because they had bad reactions. A few of those reactions, he reported at the New Orleans meeting, happened at home.\n\nThose reactions are what worry more mainstream allergists. They say there are no standards for the right dose of food allergen, the right way to select patients or how to carry out the treatment. According to Wood and the authors of the recent editorial, up to 18% of patients won\u2019t be able to tolerate the side effects.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m real scared about putting peanut powder in children with peanut allergies,\u201d says Blaiss, a past president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know all the answers yet.\u201d\n\nhealth@latimes.com", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/health/la-xpm-2010-aug-02-la-he-allergies-immunotherapy-20100802-story.html", "title": "In the Works: Immunotherapy for food allergies", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "In the Works: Immunotherapy for food allergies", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/health/la-xpm-2010-aug-02-la-he-allergies-immunotherapy-20100802-story.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "lat-logo-dark-full.jpg"}, "description": "In the Works: Immunotherapy for food allergies", "site_name": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "published_time": "2010-08-02T07:00:00", "opinion": "false", "tag": "Health"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In the Works: Immunotherapy for food allergies", "site": "@latimes", "title": "In the Works: Immunotherapy for food allergies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119932621434123, "pages": 5863113009}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "description": "In the Works: Immunotherapy for food allergies", "brightspot.contentId": "00000169-988d-d37a-a1ff-9ccfe4e20000", "brightspot.cached": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1280746800.0, "source": "http://latimes.com", "summary": ""}
