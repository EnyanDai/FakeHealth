The preoperative \u201cevaluation\u201d is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it\u2019s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients\u2019 consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.\n\nThis approach \u2014 called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes \u2014 has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of \u201chot spots\u201d in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient\u2019s high- and low-functioning states.\n\nEach participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.\n\nThe team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state \u2014 and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. \u201cThe average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,\u201d Dr. Kahana said. \u201cAnd when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.\u201d\n\nDr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. \u201cEach seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren\u2019t attached to anything,\u201d Dr. Greenblatt said.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/21/us/21Memory/20MEMORY-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/21/science/20BRAIN/20BRAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/21/science/20BRAIN/20BRAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Benedict Carey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/health/brain-memory-dementia-epilepsy-treatments.html", "title": "\u2018Pacemaker\u2019 for the Brain Can Help Memory, Study Finds", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-04-20T16:01:16.000Z", "modified": "2017-04-20T16:01:14.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/benedict-carey", "tag": "Ezzyat, Youssef", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005052890, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/b8d59fae-fcdd-5c1b-9df3-70d3ee3b2440", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/3a5d469a76e447aba39041a2a02b1d40", "description": "The timing of stimulation to the brain was determined to be crucial in research published on Thursday, and it might help treat dementia, head injuries and other conditions.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/21/science/20BRAIN/20BRAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Benedict Carey", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/21/science/20BRAIN/20BRAIN-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Memory,Epilepsy,Brain,Traumatic brain injury,Research,Current Biology Journal,DARPA,Seizures,Michael J Kahana,Youssef Ezzyat", "pdate": 20170420, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/health/brain-memory-dementia-epilepsy-treatments.html", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Pacemaker\u2019 for the Brain Can Help Memory, Study Finds", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/21/science/20BRAIN/20BRAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "The right hemisphere of a study participant\u2019s brain.
