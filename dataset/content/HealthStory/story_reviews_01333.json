And nitrites help open blood vessels in the body, increasing blood flow and oxygen to places lacking in oxygen.\n\nNov. 3, 2010 -- Drinking beet juice increases blood flow to the brain in older people, a finding that suggests the dark red vegetable may fight the progression of dementia , a new study shows.\n\nBlood Flow to the Brain\n\n\u201cThere have been several very high-profile studies showing that drinking beet juice can lower blood pressure, but we wanted to show that drinking beet juice also increases perfusion, or blood flow, to the brain,\u201d Daniel Kim-Shapiro, PhD, director of the Translational Science Center at Wake Forest University, says in a news release. \u201cThere are areas in the brain that become poorly perfused as you age, and that\u2019s believed to be associated with dementia and poor cognition.\u201d\n\nResearchers from the Translational Science Center looked at how dietary nitrates affected 14 adults aged 70 and older over a four-day period. On day one, subjects reported to a laboratory after a 10-hour fast, completed a health status report, and had either a high- or low-nitrate breakfast. The high-nitrate breakfast included 16 ounces of beet juice.\n\nThen they were sent home with lunch, dinner, and snacks that conformed to their assigned diets.\n\nOn the second day, after another 10-hour fast, the participants returned to the lab and ate their assigned breakfasts. An hour later, an MRI scan recorded brain flow in each person\u2019s brain. And blood tests before and after breakfast confirmed nitrite levels in the body.\n\nOn the third and fourth days, researchers switched diets and repeated the process for each person.\n\nMRI scans showed that after eating a high-nitrate diet, the older adults had increased blood flow to the white matter of the frontal lobes, which are the areas of the brain most commonly associated with the degeneration that leads to dementia and other cognitive conditions.", "images":
