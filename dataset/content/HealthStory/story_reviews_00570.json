The researchers said this was important, since lack of motivation is a common feature of schizophrenia.\n\n\u201cWe need a way of treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as problems with episodic memory, but slow progress is being made toward developing a drug treatment,\u201d said Barbara Sahakian from the department of psychiatry at Cambridge University.\n\n\u201cThis proof-of-concept study...demonstrates that the memory game can help where drugs have so far failed. (And) because the game is interesting, even those patients with a general lack of motivation are spurred on to continue the training.\u201d", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-schizophrenia-training-idUSKCN0Q81B620150803", "title": "Brain training app could help people with schizophrenia", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "technologyNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "companies-phar;everythingNews;technologyNews;healthNews;US-The-Wire;USWire_EL", "description": "A \"brain training\" iPad game developed in Britain may improve the memory of patients with schizophrenia, helping them in their daily lives at home and at work, researchers said on Monday.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "United Kingdom,Barbara Sahakian,US,HEALTH,SCHIZOPHRENIA,TRAINING,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Corporate Events,Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,Schizophrenia,Government Borrowing Requirement,Europe,Mental Illness,Science,United Kingdom", "news_keywords": "United Kingdom;Barbara Sahakian;US;HEALTH;SCHIZOPHRENIA;TRAINING;Health / Medicine;Western Europe;Living / Lifestyle;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;Corporate Events;Human Interest / Brights / Odd News;Schizophrenia;Government Borrowing Requirement;Europe;Mental Illness;Science;United Kingdom", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Aug 03 12:16:35 UTC 2015", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2015-08-03T12:16:35+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-schizophrenia-training-idUSKCN0Q81B620150803", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Brain training app could help people with schizophrenia", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United Kingdom,Barbara Sahakian,US,HEALTH,SCHIZOPHRENIA,TRAINING,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Corporate Events,Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,Schizophrenia,Government Borrowing Requirement,Europe,Mental Illness,Science,United Kingdom", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HEALTH-SCHIZOPHRENIA-TRAINING", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Brain training app could help people with schizophrenia", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-03T12:16:35+0000", "sailthru.title": "Brain training app could help people with schizophrenia", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Brain training app could help people with schizophrenia", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-schizophrenia-training-idUSKCN0Q81B620150803", "type": "article", "description": "A \"brain training\" iPad game developed in Britain may improve the memo...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-03T12:16:35+0000", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T12:16:35+0000", "section": "companies-health", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "United Kingdom,Barbara Sahakian,US,HEALTH,SCHIZOPHRENIA,TRAINING,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Corporate Events,Human Interest / Brights / Odd News,Schizophrenia,Government Borrowing Requirement,Europe,Mental Illness,Science,United Kingdom"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Brain training app could help people with schizophrenia", "description": "A \"brain training\" iPad game developed in Britain may improve the memory of patients with schizophrenia, helping them in their daily lives at home and at work, researchers said on Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "companies-health -
