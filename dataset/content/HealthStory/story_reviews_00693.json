Born with scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, she was later in a car accident, then a white-water rafting accident that made her back problems worse.\n\n\u201cI had so much pain that I would wake up and reach my arm out to touch my alarm \u2026 and something would just snap,\u201d the 26-year-old who now lives in Aruba said.\n\nWhen she was a teen, doctors recommended surgery to straighten her spine. Both her aunt and grandmother also were diagnosed with scoliosis. Her aunt opted for the back surgery, which helped alleviate pain but also left her with very limited movement in her spine.\n\nThen, a friend suggested Brathen try yoga. She decided to try a few classes before undergoing the knife.\n\nMore than 22 million people practice yoga in the United States, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. Many of them practice to improve flexibility and find pain relief, according to the Yoga Journal.\n\nBut as Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor, noted, it\u2019s difficult to pin down whether yoga is effective at easing symptoms of those who have back pain.\n\n\u201cThere are many types of yoga and so many different causes of back pain,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the lack of conclusive research, Besser said, there is some recent evidence to suggest that people with chronic low-back pain who do a carefully adapted set of yoga poses may experience less pain and improve their ability to walk and move.\n\nBen Kane\n\nIn one randomized controlled trial published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, back pain patients who learned yoga had better back function and were better able to manage their pain. Another study in the same journal showed that yoga improved disability from chronic back pain more than exercise or self-care instructions.\n\nThere is also a close relationship between yoga and stress, so taking yoga might reduce stress and, in turn, provide some relief to someone with a tense, achy back, noted Dr. Amit Sood, professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nBut as good as yoga may be for soothing stress and a sore back, Sood recommended getting medical clearance first and taking it slow and easy to start.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Brathen did.\n\nShe started with gentle, restorative classes that focused on improving the core strength of her middle muscles. Little by little she noticed the pain was less intense and less frequent. She said it took years to move from a slow, meditative practice to more rigorous poses.\n\nToday, she is not only nearly pain free, she is able to do advanced moves like handstands and acrobatic arm balances.\n\nBrathen said she is so grateful for her yoga practice, she became an instructor. Now she travels the world teaching yoga and sharing her story. She started a social media challenge with the hashtag #yogaeverydamnday that has 1.6 million fans on Instagram.\n\nBut she said yoga has done more for her than just heal her lower back.\n\n\u201cYoga helps with a feeling of well-being on so many levels,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world could benefit more from people with flexible hearts than flexible bodies.\u201d\n\nBen Kane\n\nTweet Chat on the health benefits of yoga, today at 1PM, ET\n\nHas your mind, body and spirit been helped in some way by yoga?
