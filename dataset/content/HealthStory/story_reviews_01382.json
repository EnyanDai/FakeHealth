But their results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors include Dr. Stephen Duffy, an epidemiologist at the University of London, and Dr. Laszlo Tabar, professor of radiology at the University of Uppsala School of Medicine in Sweden, who have long been advocates of mammography screening. Their paper is published online in the journal Cancer and will be presented on Friday at a meeting sponsored by the American Society for Clinical Oncology and five other organizations.\n\nThe study\u2019s conclusions contrast with those of a report last year by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group that issues guidelines on cancer screening, questioning the benefit of screening women younger than 50.\n\nThe new study took advantage of circumstances in Sweden, where since 1986 some counties have offered mammograms to women in their 40s and others have not, according to the lead author, Hakan Jonsson, professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe researchers compared breast cancer deaths in women who had a breast cancer diagnosis in counties that had screening with deaths in counties that did not. The rate was 26 percent lower in counties with screening.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/29/health/research/mammogram/mammogram-articleLarge.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/29/health/research/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/29/health/research/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/health/research/30mammogram.html", "title": "Mammogram Benefit Is Seen for Women in Their 40s", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069110343", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/health/research/30mammogram.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/health/research/30mammogram.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069110343"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/health/research/30mammogram.html", "title": "Mammogram Benefit Is Seen for Women in Their 40s", "description": "Researchers found a 26 percent reduction in the breast cancer death rate in a Swedish study, but some experts said they may have overestimated the benefit.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "ginakolata"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Mammogram Benefit Seen For Women in Their 40s", "description": "Researchers found a 26 percent reduction in the breast cancer death rate in a Swedish study, but some experts said they may have overestimated the benefit.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1248069110343, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Mammogram Benefit Is Seen for Women in Their 40s", "pdate": 20100929, "utime": 20141007041018, "ptime": 20100929180138, "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 29, 2010", "dat": "Sept. 29, 2010", "lp": "Researchers found a 26 percent reduction in the breast cancer death rate in a Swedish study, but some experts said they may have overestimated the benefit.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "30mammogram", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-09-29T18:01:38-04:00", "modified": "2014-10-07T04:10:18-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/gina.kolata.1", "tag": "University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/health/research/30mammogram.html", "type": "article", "title": "Mammogram Benefit Is Seen for Women in Their 40s", "description": "Researchers found a 26 percent reduction in the breast cancer death rate in a Swedish study, but some experts said they may have overestimated the benefit.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/29/health/research/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Gina Kolata", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By GINA KOLATA", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "research", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Women and Girls", "org": "University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center", "keywords": "Mammography,Breasts,Cancer,Medicine and Health,Women and Girls,University of London,United States Preventive Services Task Force,University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/29/health/research/mammogram/mammogram-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/research", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1285819200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
