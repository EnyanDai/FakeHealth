Most sleep aids, including Sanofi\u2019s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA.\n\n\u201cThese treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,\u201d said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study.\n\nGABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems.\n\n\u201cWhen you hit those, you don\u2019t just hit the sleep system,\u201d John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study\u2019s authors, said in a telephone interview.\n\nSuvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night.\n\nOrexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said.\n\nFor this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system.\n\n\u201cHow impaired would they be?\u201d Renger said.\n\nTo test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said.\n\nThe team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again.\n\nIn the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22.\n\nEmmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise.\n\n\u201cAre DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,\u201d Mignot wrote.\n\nSo far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.\n\nThe most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness. No serious drug-related side effects have been reported.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sleep-drug-idUSBRE93210T20130403", "title": "Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects: Merck study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;medical-research;commodities-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;africa-news;consolidated-business", "description": "A study in rats and monkeys suggests an experimental Merck & Co sleep drug may help induce sleep without causing the memory loss and attention problems sometimes seen in the commonly used drugs Ambien and Lunesta, company researchers said on Wednesday.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "United States,Emmanuel Mignot,Jason Uslaner,John Renger,US,SLEEP,DRUG,Commodities Markets,Company News,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Regulation,Healthcare (TRBC),Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),France,Africa,United States", "news_keywords": "United States;Emmanuel Mignot;Jason Uslaner;John Renger;US;SLEEP;DRUG;Commodities Markets;Company News;Health / Medicine;Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy);Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Regulation;Healthcare (TRBC);Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);France;Africa;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Apr 03 19:13:13 UTC 2013", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2013-04-03T19:13:13+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sleep-drug-idUSBRE93210T20130403", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects: Merck study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Emmanuel Mignot,Jason Uslaner,John Renger,US,SLEEP,DRUG,Commodities Markets,Company News,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Regulation,Healthcare (TRBC),Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),France,Africa,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-SLEEP-DRUG", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects: Merck study", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2013-04-03T19:13:13+0000", "sailthru.title": "Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects: Merck study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects: Merck study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sleep-drug-idUSBRE93210T20130403", "type": "article", "description": "A study in rats and monkeys suggests an experimental Merck & Co sleep drug may h...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2013-04-03T19:13:13+0000", "modified_time": "2013-04-03T19:13:13+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "United States,Emmanuel Mignot,Jason Uslaner,John Renger,US,SLEEP,DRUG,Commodities Markets,Company News,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Regulation,Healthcare (TRBC),Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),France,Africa,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Experimental sleep drug may cause fewer side effects: Merck study", "description": "A study in rats and monkeys suggests an experimental Merck & Co sleep drug may help induce sleep without causing the memory loss and attention problems sometimes seen in the commonly used drugs Ambien...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
