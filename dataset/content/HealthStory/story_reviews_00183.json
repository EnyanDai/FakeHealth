Ms. Imhof, a lawyer, was afraid that blow-drying her straight dark hair would hasten the shedding, so she got up two hours early to shower and apply mousse and volumizers. When her hair finally air-dried, she\u2019d pull it back, hoping to hide the bald patches on her scalp.\n\n\u201cI was desperate,\u201d she said.\n\nThe hair thickening shampoo Nioxin didn\u2019t help. Neither did Rogaine. Then she heard about Harklinikken, a Danish company offering a customized hair extract that\u2019s given only to those who pass a fairly rigorous selection process.\n\nMs. Imhof, who lives in Land O\u2019Lakes, Fla., was skeptical. The company\u2019s before and after photos seemed too good to be true. But she went for a consultation and made the cut. (Harklinikken\u2019s products are not available to anyone with autoimmune illnesses like alopecia or baldness from scarring, or anyone who is unlikely to see at least a 30 percent increase in growth.)\n\nAfter three months of applying the $88-a-month serum, Ms. Imhof was so excited by the results that she overcame her embarrassment about the subject and posted her own before-and-after photos on Facebook.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/24/fashion/24SKIN/24SKIN-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/24/fashion/24SKIN/24SKIN-articleInline-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/24/fashion/24SKIN/24SKIN-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courtney Rubin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/fashion/hair-loss-treatments-harklinikken.html", "title": "Thinning Hair?
