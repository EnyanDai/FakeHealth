That\u2019s because HPV \u2014 which causes changes in the cervix that can lead to cancer \u2014 may take a decade to progress to that point.\n\n\u201cNo test is perfect,\u201d said Philip Castle, an HPV expert at the American Society for Clinical Pathology in Chicago. But, he added, \u201ca single negative HPV test is very good at ruling out disease.\u201d\n\nEven when doctors use just a Pap test, Roland said, a woman who has had a few normal tests in a row can go two or three years before her next screening.\n\nFor the current study, she and her colleagues sent out questionnaires to a representative sample of about 600 office-based doctors and hospital departments around the country. They asked doctors and staff what tests they used for cervical cancer screening and presented them with three patient scenarios.\n\nIn those scenarios, a woman age 30 to 60 has had two consecutive normal Pap tests but no HPV tests; two normal Paps and a negative HPV test; or a negative HPV test but no recent Pap tests.\n\nIn all of those cases, guidelines recommend waiting three years before screening the patient again, the authors explain in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. But for each scenario, between 67 percent and 85 percent of doctors said they would bring the woman back in a year.\n\nAnd those extra tests aren\u2019t harmless.\n\nRoland pointed to the extra costs women may incur to get childcare and make it to the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 plus the costs to a strained healthcare system of ordering more tests.\n\nAnd any extra screening increases the chance of getting a \u201cfalse positive\u201d result on a test \u2014 meaning the test finds something that doesn\u2019t turn out to be cancer. In that case, women would need more invasive tests to rule out disease, Roland said, and risk \u201cundue harm\u201d from those procedures.\n\n\u201cSome of it is, don\u2019t go looking before you need to go looking because you\u2019ll find stuff that you\u2019d rather not find,\u201d said Castle, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nResults from a survey of the same doctors have shown that many also give the HPV test alongside Pap smears to women under 30 \u2014 which is not recommended, because HPV is common in young women and often goes away on its own (see Reuters Health story of July 4, 2011.)\n\nCastle said there could be a few reasons that doctors opt to screen women more often than is recommended. First, they might not know about the guidelines. But women may also be used to annual testing and ask for it themselves.\n\nIn addition, Roland added, some doctors might be afraid of missing very early cervical cancer and getting sued if they screen less frequently.\n\nBut if doctors and hospitals want to rein in spending and limit unnecessary risks, that attitude has to change, researchers agreed.\n\n\u201cWe need to shift toward the wellness visit as opposed to, \u2018You have to come in here every year for a Pap,\u2019\u201d Castle said.\n\nWomen should talk to their doctors about screening, especially if they think they are being screened too often, researchers added.\n\n\u201cA woman should know what test is being used,\u201d said Dr. Mona Saraiya, a co-author on the new study. \u201cOften a provider just does the HPV test\u201d without telling the patient. \u201cA woman should say, \u2018What screening tests are you doing on me?\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd if doctors want women to come back again next year, women should ask them why, Saraiya said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qdt5M1 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, online August 18, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Genevra Pittman", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cervical-cancer-screen-idUSTRE77H0XD20110818", "title": "Doctors screen for cervical cancer too often: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
