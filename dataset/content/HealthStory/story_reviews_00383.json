It\u2019s a process that\u2019s undeniably inconvenient, yet one we\u2019re told is unquestionably necessary.\n\nThat\u2019s a shame. Because although colonoscopy certainly has its advantages, direct evidence that it\u2019s the best way to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer is not one of them. And the drawbacks of colonoscopy \u2014 including the time commitment, not-so-fun preparation, expense and small chance of harm \u2014 are probably keeping some people from participating in colorectal cancer screening.\n\nAccording to public health experts, that\u2019s a bad thing. The United States Preventive Services Task Force says the net benefit for screening adults age 50-75 is \u201csubstantial,\u201d adding that colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the country. But as of 2012, just 65 percent of eligible adults were being screened as recommended, and almost 28 percent had never been screened.\n\nAmong those who are screened, colonoscopy is by far the most popular method in the U.S. But there is a menu of options beyond colonoscopies \u2014 and they\u2019re not necessarily any better or worse, according to the USPSTF\u2019s recently finalized updated recommendations for screening among average-risk adults. The group said that while some tests are backed by more evidence than others, it found no head-to-head studies suggesting any strategy \u2014 including colonoscopy \u2014 is better than another. \u201cChoose the one that fits your preferences and lifestyle,\u201d said Douglas Owens, a physician and member of the task force.\n\nIncluded on the list are two cheap, at-home poop tests intended to be done annually: the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) and a more sensitive test called the fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. Both look for tiny amounts of blood in the stool that might be shed by cancer or polyps. You get one from your doctor, take a poop sample at home, and then return the sample to the doctor. Only if you get a positive result do you need to have a colonoscopy. (These are different from a new stool-based DNA test, which while on the USPSTF\u2019s list is much more expensive and has been studied less.)\n\nOf the two, Richard Wender, a physician and chief cancer control officer of the American Cancer Society, said the FIT is preferable, both because it\u2019s more accurate and because it requires only one poop sample and no changes in diet. It costs about $25 or less and when done every year, the USPSTF\u2019s models estimate, it will avert 20-23 deaths from colorectal cancer per 1,000 people screened. (Wender doesn\u2019t recommend the OTC tests that are available.)\n\nThat\u2019s comparable to the two \u201cscope\u201d tests on the USPSTF\u2019s list, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, which have the advantage of both detecting and removing precancerous polyps in one procedure. (Flexible sigmoidoscopy, which looks at the lower part of the large intestine, has been shown by randomized trials to prevent deaths from colorectal cancer but isn\u2019t reimbursed as well as colonoscopy and is on the decline in the U.S.)\n\nColonoscopy is the most popular test in the U.S. In addition to its polyp-removing ability, if you have a negative test, you don\u2019t have to come back for another 10 years. There is indirect evidence it reduces colorectal cancer deaths, in the form of a large study following people who did and didn\u2019t get the test over time. And it seems logical that if sigmoidoscopy cuts colorectal cancer deaths, the more extensive colonoscopy must provide a similar benefit. But that\u2019s not yet been proved by randomized controlled trials. Based on the available evidence and its modeling, the USPSTF estimates it reduces deaths from colorectal cancer by 22-24 per 1,000 people screened.\n\nBut that lack of trial data is why the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care earlier this year recommended against using colonoscopy as a first-line screening method. \u201cThey were very clear: We\u2019re going to stick to the evidence, and right now we don\u2019t have evidence for colonoscopy,\u201d said Aasma Shaukat, section chief of gastroenterology in the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.\n\nColonoscopy also has plenty of downsides. It\u2019s expensive, running upward of $1,000. (The test is covered without cost sharing as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act.) Most people prefer to have sedation during the procedure, which means time off from work and finding a ride home. There\u2019s variation in the quality of the test, depending on who\u2019s doing it. There\u2019s a small but real risk of harm, such as a perforation.\n\nSo why do so many people prefer it to the poop test? For many, because they\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the best test to get. A 2012 study found primary care physicians overwhelmingly said they thought it was the best colorectal screening option. Katie Couric\u2019s on-air colonoscopy in March 2000 boosted awareness and increased colonoscopy rates. There\u2019s also a \u201cmore is better\u201d attitude when it comes to medicine among many people, said Shaukat. And colonoscopies are well-reimbursed for the physicians who perform them. Hospitals have focused on marketing colonoscopies rather than alternative tests.\n\nNo one is arguing colonoscopy is a bad test. It just hasn\u2019t been shown to be better than an annual FIT, said James Allison, a clinical professor of medicine emeritus at the University of California-San Francisco. He said the public health message is slowly changing to reflect that. The 80% by 2018 campaign from the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, for example, which aims to increase the rate of screening, emphasizes a suite of options. \u201cPeople are very motivated to get screened when they hear colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death and if they know there are tests that are affordable and can be done at home,\u201d said Wender.\n\nSo if you want a colonoscopy after talking with your physician and digging into all its pros and cons \u2014 fantastic. But if you prefer something less invasive but more frequent, you can test your poop every year without feeling like you\u2019re opting for, um, No. 2.", "images": ["https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2020-tracker-4x3.png?w=300", "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/themes/espn-fivethirtyeight/assets/images/logo-fox-head-color.svg", "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/colon_538-01.jpeg?w=575"], "top_img": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/colon_538-01.jpeg?w=575", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Hobson"], "canonical_link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-could-skip-your-colonoscopy-if-youre-willing-to-collect-your-poop/", "title": "You Could Skip Your Colonoscopy If You\u2019re Willing To Collect Your Poop", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "You Could Skip Your Colonoscopy If You\u2019re Willing To Collect Your Poop", "url": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-could-skip-your-colonoscopy-if-youre-willing-to-collect-your-poop/", "description": "Most Americans hear \u201ccolorectal cancer screening\u201d and think \u201ccolonoscopy\u201d \u2014 the unpleasant cleanse, the snakelike scope, the wobbly ride home.
