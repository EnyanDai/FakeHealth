Several studies indicate that babies born prematurely receive too little DHA, and some studies have found that premature babies fed DHA after birth show better cognitive performance or visual coordination later on than preemies who aren\u2019t given DHA.\n\nBut the new study, which mainly assessed full-term babies, found no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that \u201cthere\u2019s no extra boost\u201d from getting more.\n\nNonetheless, several experts said they would continue to support taking DHA in pregnancy, especially since it is safe and apparently has few downsides. They cited a smaller 2003 Norwegian study that found I.Q. increases at age 4, although no cognitive benefit was seen in infants or 7-year-olds.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study. Dr. Oken said the new study might have shown no benefit in 18-month-olds because effects in infants might be \u201chard to measure\u201d or \u201cit may be that the benefit of DHA is not as important as when you\u2019re 4.\u201d\n\nDr. Makrides\u2019s team plans assessments at 4 and 7. Dr. Jatinder Bhatia, a neonatologist heading the nutrition committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that unless further studies showed no benefit as children got older, he would continue recommending DHA, now in many prenatal vitamins, because \u201cI\u2019m not convinced at this time that we should reverse course.\u201d\n\nMuch about DHA is unknown. Its effect in supplements for children and adults is being studied, as well as whether supplements offer the same benefit as DHA-rich fish, like salmon.\n\nSome studies, including the new report, suggest DHA supplementation in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of premature birth. And the new study showed small reductions in postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression. Dr. Scott Stuart, a University of Iowa psychiatry and psychology professor, said his pregnant patients with mild to moderate depression had improved when taking DHA while seeing a counselor.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no harm that we know of at all, in contrast to many antidepressants,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it might be of some help.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/20/us/fish-oil/fish-oil-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/20/us/fish-oil/fish-oil-thumbStandard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/20/us/fish-oil/fish-oil-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pam Belluck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/health/research/20fishoil.html", "title": "Fish Oil Use in Pregnancy Didn\u2019t Make Babies Smart", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069205994", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/health/research/20fishoil.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/health/research/20fishoil.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069205994"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/health/research/20fishoil.html", "title": "Fish Oil Use in Pregnancy Didn\u2019t Make Babies Smart", "description": "Supplements containing a fish oil ingredient, encouraged by many obstetricians and marketing campaigns, produced no clear cognitive benefit compared with a placebo.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "PamBelluck"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Fish Oil Use In Pregnancy Didn\u2019t Make Babies Smart", "description": "Supplements containing a fish oil ingredient, encouraged by many obstetricians and marketing campaigns, produced no clear cognitive benefit compared with a placebo.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1248069205994, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Fish Oil Use in Pregnancy Didn\u2019t Make Babies Smart", "pdate": 20101019, "utime": 20150121235754, "ptime": 20101019214704, "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 19, 2010", "dat": "Oct. 19, 2010", "lp": "Supplements containing a fish oil ingredient, encouraged by many obstetricians and marketing campaigns, produced no clear cognitive benefit compared with a placebo.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "20fishoil", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-10-19T21:47:04-04:00", "modified": "2015-01-21T23:57:54-05:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/pam-belluck", "tag": "Dhaka (Bangladesh)"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/health/research/20fishoil.html", "type": "article", "title": "Fish Oil Use in Pregnancy Didn\u2019t Make Babies Smart", "description": "Supplements containing a fish oil ingredient, encouraged by many obstetricians and marketing campaigns, produced no clear cognitive benefit compared with a placebo.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/20/us/fish-oil/fish-oil-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Pam Belluck", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By PAM BELLUCK", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "research", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Medicine and Health", "geo": "Dhaka (Bangladesh)", "ad-sponsor": "Fish Oil,Docosahexaenoic Acid", "keywords": "Pregnancy and Obstetrics,Babies,Medicine and Health,Dhaka (Bangladesh),Fish Oil,Docosahexaenoic Acid", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/20/us/fish-oil/fish-oil-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/research", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1287547200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
