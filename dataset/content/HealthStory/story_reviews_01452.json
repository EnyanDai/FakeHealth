It\u2019s defined by what the patient tells you,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some patients\u2019 families and their doctors to get their head around what it is and whether it\u2019s real. So, that these results were so positive for something that\u2019s very safe is an impressive accomplishment.\u201d\n\nRecent studies have suggested that tai chi, with its slow exercises, breathing and meditation, could benefit patients with other chronic conditions, including arthritis. But not all of these reports have been conclusive, and tai chi is hard to study because there are many styles and approaches.\n\nThe fibromyalgia study involved the yang style of tai chi, taught by a Boston tai chi master, Ramel Rones. Dr. Solomon and other experts cautioned that bigger studies with other masters and approaches were necessary.\n\nStill, patients, who received twice-weekly tai chi classes and a DVD to practice with 20 minutes daily, showed weekly improvement on an established measurement, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, improving more than the stretching-and-education group in physicians\u2019 assessments, sleep, walking and mental health. One-third stopped using medication, compared with one-sixth in the stretching group.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

I thought this is so minimal, it\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAfter a few weeks, she said she began to feel better, and after 12 weeks \u201cthe pain had diminished 90 percent.\u201d She has continued tai chi, lost 50 pounds and can walk three to seven miles a day.\n\n\u201cYou could not have convinced me that I would ever have done this or continued with this,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a cure. I will say it\u2019s an effective method of controlling pain.\u201d\n\nDr. Shmerling said that though tai chi is inexpensive compared with other treatments, some patients would reject such an alternative therapy. And Dr. Gloria Yeh, a Beth Israel Deaconess internist and co-author of the editorial, said others \u201cwill say, \u2018It\u2019s too slow, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut she said it offered a \u201cgentler option\u201d for patients deterred by other physical activities. \u201cThe mind-body connections set it apart from other exercises,\u201d she said, adding that doctors are seeking \u201canything we can offer that will make patients say \u2018I can really do this.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/19/health/19taichi1/19taichi1-articleLarge.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/19/health/19taichi1/19taichi1-thumbStandard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/19/health/19taichi1/19taichi1-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pam Belluck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/health/19taichi.html", "title": "Tai Chi Eases Symptoms of Fibromyalgia, Study Finds", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1247468651574", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/health/19taichi.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/health/19taichi.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1247468651574"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/health/19taichi.html", "title": "Tai Chi Eases Symptoms of Fibromyalgia, Study Finds", "description": "Slow exercise and meditation as practiced in an ancient Chinese regimen may help sufferers of a mysterious and controversial disease.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "PamBelluck"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Tai Chi Seen as Fibromyalgia Therapy", "description": "Slow exercise and meditation as practiced in an ancient Chinese regimen may help sufferers of a mysterious and controversial disease.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1247468651574, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Tai Chi Eases Symptoms of Fibromyalgia, Study Finds", "pdate": 20100818, "utime": 20141002035210, "ptime": 20100818183902, "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 18, 2010", "dat": "Aug. 18, 2010", "lp": "Slow exercise and meditation as practiced in an ancient Chinese regimen may help sufferers of a mysterious and controversial disease.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "19taichi", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-08-18T18:39:02-04:00", "modified": "2014-10-02T03:52:10-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/index.html", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/pam-belluck", "tag": "Fibromyalgia"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/19/health/19taichi.html", "type": "article", "title": "Tai Chi Eases Symptoms of Fibromyalgia, Study Finds", "description": "Slow exercise and meditation as practiced in an ancient Chinese regimen may help sufferers of a mysterious and controversial disease.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/19/health/19taichi1/19taichi1-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Pam Belluck", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By PAM BELLUCK", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Fibromyalgia", "keywords": "Tai Chi (Oriental Exercise),Fibromyalgia", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/19/health/19taichi1/19taichi1-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1282190400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
