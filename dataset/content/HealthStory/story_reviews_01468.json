And they detected Alzheimer\u2019s proteins in 36 percent of people with normal brain function.\n\nThe study is the latest to show that measuring disease-related proteins in spinal fluid is useful in diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nCurrently, only an autopsy can confirm that a person has Alzheimer\u2019s, a fatal and incurable deterioration of the brain that affects more than 26 million people globally.\n\nDoctors diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s by excluding other causes of memory loss, such as stroke, tumors and heavy drinking. They can also administer simple paper-and-pencil tests.\n\nBut biomarkers \u2014 proteins and imaging techniques \u2014 are helping to identify the disease much earlier.\n\nLast month, experts at the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer\u2019s Association proposed new guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s even before patients have symptoms. [ID:nN13273900] These proposed rules included measurements of cerebral-spinal fluid.\n\nIn the study, De Meyer and colleagues analyzed spinal fluid from 114 adults with normal brain function, 200 who had mild cognitive impairment \u2014 a precursor to dementia \u2014 and 102 who had Alzheimer\u2019s. They identified one protein signature that was associated with Alzheimer\u2019s, and another that indicated healthy brain function.\n\nWhen they looked to see how accurate these signatures were at spotting the disease, they found 90 percent of those with Alzheimer\u2019s had the disease pattern in their spinal fluid. The pattern was present in 72 percent of those with mild cognitive impairment and 36 percent of those who were normal.", "images": ["https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100810&t=2&i=176723151&w=1200&r=2010-08-10T162508Z_01_BTRE67919M100_RTROPTP_0_PORTUGAL", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100810&t=2&i=176723151&r=2010-08-10T162508Z_01_BTRE67919M100_RTROPTP_0_PORTUGAL&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100810&t=2&i=176723151&w=1200&r=2010-08-10T162508Z_01_BTRE67919M100_RTROPTP_0_PORTUGAL", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers-diagnosis-idUSTRE6784I020100810", "title": "Spinal fluid proteins can help diagnose Alzheimer's", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "scienceNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "scienceNews;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Measuring certain proteins in spinal fluid can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's and predict which patients with memory problems will develop the fatal brain-wasting disease, Belgian researchers said on Monday.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "Belgium,Cynthia Osterman,Julie Steenhuysen,US,ALZHEIMERS,DIAGNOSIS", "news_keywords": "Belgium;Cynthia Osterman;Julie Steenhuysen;US;ALZHEIMERS;DIAGNOSIS", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Aug 10 16:25:13 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-08-10T16:25:13+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers-diagnosis-idUSTRE6784I020100810", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Spinal fluid proteins can help diagnose Alzheimer's", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Belgium,Cynthia Osterman,Julie Steenhuysen,US,ALZHEIMERS,DIAGNOSIS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-ALZHEIMERS-DIAGNOSIS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Spinal fluid proteins can help diagnose Alzheimer's", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2010-08-10T16:25:13+0000", "sailthru.title": "Spinal fluid proteins can help diagnose Alzheimer's", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Spinal fluid proteins can help diagnose Alzheimer's", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers-diagnosis-idUSTRE6784I020100810", "type": "article", "description": "Measuring certain proteins in spinal fluid can accurately diagnose Alzheimer", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100810&t=2&i=176723151&w=1200&r=2010-08-10T162508Z_01_BTRE67919M100_RTROPTP_0_PORTUGAL", "article": {"published_time": "2010-08-10T16:25:13+0000", "modified_time": "2010-08-10T16:25:13+0000", "section": "Technology", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "Belgium,Cynthia Osterman,Julie Steenhuysen,US,ALZHEIMERS,DIAGNOSIS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Spinal fluid proteins can help diagnose Alzheimer's", "description": "Measuring certain proteins in spinal fluid can accurately diagnose Alzheimer's and predict which patients with memory problems will develop the fatal brain-wasting disease, Belgian researchers sa...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100810&t=2&i=176723151&w=1200&r=2010-08-10T162508Z_01_BTRE67919M100_RTROPTP_0_PORTUGAL", "src": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100810&t=2&i=176723151&w=1200&r=2010-08-10T162508Z_01_BTRE67919M100_RTROPTP_0_PORTUGAL"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tech/science/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article - News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Technology - Science", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Technology", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Science", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1281457513.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
