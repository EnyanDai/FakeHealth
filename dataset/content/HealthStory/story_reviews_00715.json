But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNormal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.\n\n\"The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,\" Lerman said in an interview. \"Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?\"\n\nThis may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said.\n\n\"Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,\" Lerman said. \"The trial and error approach is not optimal.\"\n\nAD\n\nResearchers did not test nicotine gum because it delivers a less consistent flow of nicotine to the user, she said. The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.\n\nIn some of the test groups, overall success rates were fairly low, Lerman noted, but the study was conducted during the Great Recession, a time when financial stress may have depressed the chances of succeeding for everyone, regardless of which approach was used.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/50hMVkoWHKP-AiimLQxESs495qA=/150x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JZUAU5B2XIZAXKFPHYEQU7WHDE.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EWxaEfogFZj4C8vbonaf5oqNyIw=/90x90/smart/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/033c1b1b-8262-4f85-9f09-5edd9ab3e4c8.png", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=148"], "top_img": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=148", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lenny Bernstein", "Reporter Covering Health", "Health Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/01/13/a-better-way-to-help-people-quit-smoking/", "title": "A better way to help people quit smoking?", "meta_data": {"description": "Study shows a better way to determine which drug smokers should take when they're trying to kick the habit.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/01/13/a-better-way-to-help-people-quit-smoking/", "title": "A better way to help people quit smoking?", "description": "Study shows a better way to determine which drug smokers should take when they're trying to kick the habit."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A better way to help people quit smoking?", "description": "Study shows a better way to determine which drug smokers should take when they're trying to kick the habit."}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1421125200.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
