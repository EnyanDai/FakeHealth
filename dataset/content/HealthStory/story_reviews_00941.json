Connolly, director of Harvard\u2019s Center for Global Tobacco Control and a co-author of the study. \u201cI ran a treatment program for years, and we invested\u201d millions in treatment services.\n\nDoctors who treat smokers said that the study findings were not unexpected, given the haphazard way many smokers used the products. \u201cPatient compliance is a very big issue,\u201d said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic , who was not involved in the study.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Hurt said products like nicotine gum and patches \u201care absolutely essential, but we use them in combinations and doses that match treatment to what the individual patient needs,\u201d unlike smokers who are self-treating.\n\nThe products have been controversial since at least 2002, when researchers at the University of California, San Diego , reported from a large survey that they appeared to offer no benefit. The study did not follow people over time. A government-appointed panel that included nicotine replacement as part of federal guidelines for treatment also came under fire, because panel members had gotten payments from the product manufacturers.\n\n\u201cSome studies have questioned these treatments, but the bulk of clinical trials have unequivocally endorsed them,\u201d said Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the University of Wisconsin \u2019s Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention and the chairman of the panel that wrote the guidelines. Dr. Fiore, who has reported receiving payments from drug makers, said that \u201cthere are millions of smokers out there desperate to quit, and it would be a tragedy if they felt, because of one study, that this option is ineffective.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They interviewed the participants three times, about once every two years during the 2000s, asking the smokers and quitters about their use of gum, patches and other such products, their periods of not smoking and their relapses.\n\nAt each stage, about one-third of the people trying to quit had relapsed, the study found. The use of replacement products made no difference, whether they were taken for the recommended two-month period (they usually were not), or with the guidance of a cessation counselor.\n\nOne subgroup, heavy smokers (defined as those who had their first cigarette within a half-hour of waking up) who used replacement products without counseling, was twice as likely to relapse as heavy smokers who did not use them.\n\n\u201cOur study essentially shows that what happens in the real world is very different\u201d from what happens in clinical trials, said Hillel R. Alpert of Harvard, a co-author with Dr. Connolly and Lois Biener of the University of Massachusetts , Boston .\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/10/us/SMOKING/SMOKING-popup.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/10/us/SMOKING/SMOKING-thumbStandard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/10/us/SMOKING/SMOKING-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Benedict Carey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/health/study-finds-nicotine-gum-and-patches-dont-help-smokers-quit.html", "title": "Nicotine Replacement Doesn\u2019t Help Smokers Quit, Study Finds", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001274448", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/health/study-finds-nicotine-gum-and-patches-dont-help-smokers-quit.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/health/study-finds-nicotine-gum-and-patches-dont-help-smokers-quit.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001274448"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/health/study-finds-nicotine-gum-and-patches-dont-help-smokers-quit.html", "title": "Nicotine Replacement Doesn\u2019t Help Smokers Quit, Study Finds", "description": "Nicotine replacements have no lasting benefit in helping smokers quit and may backfire, according to the most rigorous long-term study to date.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Nicotine Gum And Skin Patch Face New Doubt", "description": "Nicotine replacements have no lasting benefit in helping smokers quit and may backfire, according to the most rigorous long-term study to date.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 100000001274448, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Nicotine Replacement Doesn\u2019t Help Smokers Quit, Study Finds", "pdate": 20120109, "utime": 20171024073346, "ptime": 20120109181842, "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 9, 2012", "dat": "Jan. 9, 2012", "lp": "Nicotine replacements have no lasting benefit in helping smokers quit and may backfire, according to the most rigorous long-term study to date.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "10smoking", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2012-01-09T18:18:42-05:00", "modified": "2017-10-24T07:33:46-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/section/health", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/benedict-carey", "tag": "Medicaid"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/health/study-finds-nicotine-gum-and-patches-dont-help-smokers-quit.html", "type": "article", "title": "Nicotine Replacement Doesn\u2019t Help Smokers Quit, Study Finds", "description": "Nicotine replacements have no lasting benefit in helping smokers quit and may backfire, according to the most rigorous long-term study to date.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/10/us/SMOKING/SMOKING-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Benedict Carey", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By BENEDICT CAREY", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Medicaid", "keywords": "Smoking and Tobacco,Nicotine,Medicaid,Tobacco Control", "news_keywords": "Smoking,Nicotine,Medicaid,Tobacco Control", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/10/us/SMOKING/SMOKING-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1326171600.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
