(Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.\n\nBefore having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from \u201cnot at all\u201d to \u201cvery much.\u201d Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.\n\nThe study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.\n\nWhen choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.\n\nThere was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cInsulin is released when we consume glucose,\u201d she said. \u201cThe pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy. But it also sends a signal to the brain that says \u2018you\u2019ve eaten.\u2019 Fructose doesn\u2019t stimulate insulin secretion, and if there\u2019s no insulin, you don\u2019t get the information that you\u2019re full.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean that it is a good idea to avoid fruit, because it contains fructose?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Page said. \u201cDon\u2019t stop eating fruit. It has a relatively low amount of sugar compared with processed foods and soft drinks \u2014 maybe 5 grams in an orange, compared with 25 grams in a 12-ounce can of soda. And it is packed with fiber, which helps slow down the absorption of food, which makes you feel full.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor more fitness, food and wellness news, \u201clike\u201d our Facebook page.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/science/05food/05food-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/marketing/newsletters/images/Running_75.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/science/05food/05food-tmagArticle.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/well/well_post.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/science/05food/05food-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Bakalar"], "canonical_link": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/fructose-may-increase-cravings-for-high-calorie-foods/", "title": "Fructose May Increase Cravings for High-Calorie Foods", "meta_data": {"communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/Fructose May Increase Cravings for High-Calorie Foods ( 20150504 )", "communityAssetURL": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/fructose-may-increase-cravings-for-high-calorie-foods/", "PT": "Blogs", "PST": "Blog Post", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003664576, "author": "Nicholas Bakalar", "CLMST": "Nicholas Bakalar", "byl": "Nicholas Bakalar", "GBLC": "Eat;Featured", "PUV": "normal", "article": {"published_time": 1430731809, "modified_time": "2016-03-15T20:29:10-04:00", "section": "Health", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp"}, "PUD": 20150504, "pdate": 20150504, "ptime": 20150504053009, "utime": 20160315202910, "DISPLAYDATE": "May 4, 2015", "dat": "May 4, 2015", "CG": "Health", "SCG": "well", "BN": "well", "robots": "noodp", "des": "Calories;Food;Fruit;Insulin;Sugar", "keywords": "Calories,Food,Fruit,Insulin,Sugar,Eat,Featured,Uncategorized", "news_keywords": "Calories,Food,Fruit,Insulin,Sugar", "description": "The type of sugar you eat may affect your cravings for high-calorie foods, researchers report.", "hdl": "Fructose May Increase Cravings for High-Calorie Foods", "og": {"title": "Fructose May Increase Cravings for High-Calorie Foods", "type": "article", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/fructose-may-increase-cravings-for-high-calorie-foods/", "site_name": "Well", "description": "The type of sugar you eat may affect your cravings for high-calorie foods, researchers report.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/science/05food/05food-facebookJumbo.jpg"}, "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/science/05food/05food-thumbLarge.jpg", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Fructose May Increase Cravings for High-Calorie Foods", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/fructose-may-increase-cravings-for-high-calorie-foods/", "description": "The type of sugar you eat may affect your cravings for high-calorie foods, researchers report.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/science/05food/05food-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimeswell"}, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/05/science/05food/05food-thumbLarge.jpg", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well/eat", "categories": "eat"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1430712000.0, "source": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
