They are made from the same material that's used to create dissolving stitches.\n\nWhen researchers attach specific proteins to the particles, they say they're able to teach the body not to attack its own tissues.\n\nIf the approach succeeds in human studies, it may one day lead to more targeted treatments not only for multiple sclerosis but also for other kinds of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\u201cThis technology could be very effective,\u201d says Timothy Coetzee, PhD, chief research officer for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the researchers have picked the right proteins that might turn off the disease in humans, he says.\n\n\u201cWill these peptides actually induce tolerance in people? We just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s rational, but we won\u2019t know until we get it into people,\u201d says Coetzee, who was not involved in the research.\n\nThe research is published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Myelin Repair Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and the Australian government.", "images":
