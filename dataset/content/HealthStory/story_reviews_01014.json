That could drive down a person\u2019s risk of fatal heart attack or stroke by 10%, the authors suggested.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that people on statins should go dump their drugs for tofu, said Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Dr. Steve Nissen, who was not involved in the study. Dietary changes do not have nearly the research track record that statins have racked up for heart attack prevention, he said.\n\n\u201cPatients don\u2019t want to take the medications, and I\u2019m afraid that if you tell them there\u2019s a diet that works just as well, then they\u2019ll do that instead,\u201d he said.\n\nNearly 1 in 6 Americans has a high overall cholesterol level, which makes a person nearly twice as likely to suffer a heart attack or stroke as someone whose total cholesterol falls into a healthy range. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is one component of this overall number.\n\nLast year, statin and other lipid-regulating drugs were the nation\u2019s most commonly prescribed medications, with more than 355 million prescriptions dispensed, according to the healthcare information firm IMS Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe multi-center Canadian study tested a diet that contained a portfolio of cholesterol-fighting foods such as soy protein, nuts, \u201csticky\u201d fiber such as that found in oats and barley, and plant sterols. Subjects were instructed to eat a handful of nuts such as almonds or walnuts every day, and to substitute milk and meats with soy and tofu products as much as possible.\n\nOne of the most potent cholesterol-busters in that mix, plant sterols (sometimes called stanols), occurs in small amounts in many grains, nuts, vegetables, legumes and fruits and also can be added to foods or taken as a dietary supplement. Plant sterols mimic LDL cholesterol particles in the gut, preventing the absorption of those particles so that they pass through the body and are disposed of as waste.\n\nThe 345 subjects in the study, which was coordinated by a team based at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, Toronto, all suffered high cholesterol levels and were considered at elevated risk of coronary heart disease. The subjects each followed one of three diets: an \u201cintensive portfolio\u201d diet, a \u201croutine portfolio\u201d diet, or a high-fiber, low-saturated-fat diet rich in produce and whole grains, which is commonly recommended to those who have had had a heart attack or need to lower their cholesterol.\n\nAmong the 267 subjects who completed the trial, all three groups lost roughly an equal amount of weight \u2014 between about 2 pounds 10 ounces and 3 pounds 12 ounces \u2014 after six months. But those on one of the portfolio diets \u2014 intensive or routine \u2014 saw their LDL cholesterol levels decline between 13.1% and 13.8% after six months.\n\nSubjects on the low-saturated-fat diet had, on average, a 3% reduction in their LDL cholesterol in the same period.\n\nDr. Walter Willett, a nutrition and health expert at Harvard University\u2019s School of Public Health who was not involved in the study, said that the trial was \u201cnicely done\u201d and that it underscored the fact that \u201cjust focusing on reducing saturated and total fat is not the most effective diet for reducing heart disease risk factors or heart disease itself.\u201d\n\nThe authors acknowledged that the components in the portfolio diet were well-known for their cholesterol-busting properties. But their research is the first to test the relative effects of those dietary interventions in a real-world comparison, and to gauge how readily people can understand and implement such a diet in everyday life.\n\nIt was pretty easily done, the scientists found. Subjects in the intensive group got as many as seven sessions of instruction and guidance, while those in the routine group got one 60-minute session plus a 40-minute refresher \u2014 but both groups realized roughly equal benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe researchers also found that the greater a subject\u2019s adherence to the portfolio diet, the more dramatic, on average, was the LDL cholesterol reduction.\n\nBut Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Nissen stressed that researchers did not directly measure rates of coronary heart disease \u2014 just LDL cholesterol \u2014 so the health effects of the portfolio diet are not yet clear.\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd585f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F12%2F57%2Fa343371429b7000ea37eaded8d93%2Fimg-534f3749-turbine-la-bio-melissa-healy"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Healy Is A Health", "Science Reporter With The Los Angeles Times Writing The Washington", "D.C.", "Area.
