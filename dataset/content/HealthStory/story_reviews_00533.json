Calcium shows up as white flecks in CT scans. The hard plaques are not the dangerous ones \u2014 it is the softer ones that rupture and cause a heart attack. But the amount of calcium in arteries can give a good idea of the presence or extent of coronary artery disease.\n\nDr. Krumholz and Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist at Baptist Health South Florida, who conceived the new study, reasoned that research on heart scans had not been designed to help doctors make treatment decisions they face today.\n\nCurrent guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. Many people, though, are reluctant to take them. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated?\n\nThe study subjects were nearly 4,000 men and women ages 45 to 84 and included blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians who were recruited in 2000 through 2002. According to today\u2019s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. All had heart scans, and half had no calcium visible on the scans. The subjects were followed for 10 years.\n\nIt turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.\n\nFor example, a person who, according to the current risk calculator, has a 12 percent risk of a heart attack in the next decade should take a statin, the guidelines say. But if that person has a calcium score of zero, the actual risk turned out to be 4 percent, below the 7.5 percent threshold for recommending a statin according to the guidelines and below the 5 percent risk for considering a statin.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/science/06SCAN/06SCAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/science/06SCAN/06SCAN-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/science/06SCAN/06SCAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/health/heart-scan-can-fine-tune-risk-estimate-for-patients-considering-statins.html", "title": "Heart Scan Can Fine-Tune Risk Estimate for Patients Considering Statins", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-10-05T18:34:02.000Z", "modified": "2015-10-05T18:34:00.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata", "tag": "Research", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003937667, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/80bb5b2a-e0ff-51c8-8a6b-4909d4d93ab5", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/43b846c3390445abaf5e5568e6779df0", "description": "A study found that a CT scan could ascertain the heart health of people over 40 to better help them make a decision on taking cholesterol-lowering statins.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/science/06SCAN/06SCAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Gina Kolata", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/science/06SCAN/06SCAN-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "news_keywords": "Heart,,Statins,CT Scan,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,Harlan M Krumholz,Cholesterol,Research", "pdate": 20151005, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/health/heart-scan-can-fine-tune-risk-estimate-for-patients-considering-statins.html", "type": "article", "title": "Heart Scan Can Fine-Tune Risk Estimate for Patients Considering Statins", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/science/06SCAN/06SCAN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "Rena H.
