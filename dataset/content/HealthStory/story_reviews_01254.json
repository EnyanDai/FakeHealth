For those with this type of IBS, symptoms can include abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel function such as diarrhea.\n\nIBS is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder without a known physiologic cause, with the symptoms recurring and often worsened by stress. Existing treatment options -- diet and lifestyle modification, psychological therapy, and other drugs -- do not help all people with the condition.\n\nWith the new antibiotic treatment, Pimentel tells WebMD, many participants ''say they are 80% improved, 90% improved, that kind of results. The stool was more solid, the diarrhea goes away, and the bloating is much less.\"\n\nThat can translate to big changes in the lives of those with IBS, estimated to affect about 15% of adult Americans. With the drug treatment, Pimentel says, those with the IBS ''can enjoy social outings without the worry of having to run to the bathroom and having diarrhea.\"\n\nThe drug is approved by the FDA only for traveler's diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by chronic liver failure.", "images":
