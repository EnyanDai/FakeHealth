Insomnia, which affects a third of adults, becomes more common as we age.\n\nBut as evidence has mounted about the risks of drugging the brain to induce or maintain slumber, more doctors are steering patients away from sleep aids, including over-the-counter medications, and are offering innovative behavioral-change solutions.\n\nAfter reviewing more than 15 years of evidence, the American College of Physicians in May issued new guidelines for the management of chronic insomnia, recommending a form of counseling known as cognitive behavioral therapy as the first-line treatment for all adults. Drugs should be considered only if the therapy is unsuccessful, and only for a short course after a thorough discussion of the benefits, harms and costs, the guidelines say.\n\n\u201cDrugs don\u2019t provide a natural sleep, and the side effects are significant,\u201d says Nitin Damle, an internist and president of the American College of Physicians. \u201cIt\u2019s true in all age groups, but even more problematic for older adults.\u201d\n\nIn addition to their addictive properties, many prescription sleep aids can cause fuzzy thinking and memory gaps in the short term\u2014like being unaware of taking a drive, eating or making phone calls. As bodies age, drugs remain longer in the body due to changes such as diminished liver and kidney function, which can cause fatigue, weakness, impaired balance and a dimming of other senses, increasing the risk for falls and car accidents. Longer term, sleep drugs may contribute to more serious mental-function issues, they can be costly, and they may not be covered by insurance for more than a short period.\n\nAmong the most commonly prescribed drugs are sedative hypnotics, which slow activity in the brain to bring on sleep. They include drugs known as benzodiazapenes, sold under brand names like Halcion, and non-benzodiazapenes, such as Ambien, Lunesta and Sonata. The American Geriatrics Society recommends against using benzodiazepines or other sedative hypnotics in older adults as first choice for insomnia because large-scale studies consistently show that the risk or motor-vehicle accidents, falls and hip fractures leading to hospitalization and death can more than double in older adults taking the drugs.\n\nA new class of drugs known as orexin receptor antagonists act differently than sedative hypnotics, inhibiting the action of a chemical that promotes wakefulness. One, suvorexant, sold as Belsomra, helped people fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer in studies comparing it to a placebo, with no evidence of physical dependence after prolonged use or reports of withdrawal symptoms after stopping the drug. But as with other medications it has the potential to produce drowsiness the next day that might interfere with daily activities, and carries a warning that it may cause sleepwalking or other activities while asleep, like eating, talking, having sex or driving.\n\nOver-the-counter drugs can be risky, too, such as pain medications with sleep aids that include the antihistamine diphenhydramine, part of a type of drugs known as anticholinergics. A study last year in JAMA Internal Medicine suggested higher cumulative use of anticholinergics, which can impair memory and attention, is associated with an increased risk for dementia.\n\nDoctors may initially prescribe sleeping pills when a patient is under stress. \u201cThe intent is for them to be on a short course, and then get off of it,\u201d says David Maness, a professor of family medicine at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis. \u201cBut then the problem is perpetuated, and before you know it, it\u2019s 10 years later, and it keeps getting refilled and no one has reviewed it.\u201d\n\nA review that Dr. Maness co-wrote, published last December by the American Academy of Family Physicians, suggests that a combination of nondrug therapies can help patients just say no to sleep drugs.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy, which can be delivered in as few as two sessions with a trained therapist or nurse, has been shown to relieve chronic insomnia and improve daytime functioning for up to two years.\n\n\u201c Drugs don\u2019t provide a natural sleep, and the side effects are significant \u201d \u2014Nitin Damle, President, American College of Physicians\n\nTypically, patients are asked to fill out a sleep diary, recording their bedtime, rise time and how long it takes to fall asleep. The patients also record factors such as the number of naps, alcoholic beverages and stresses in a day. Writing down troubling thoughts and worries before bedtime may help clear the mind, making it easier to fall asleep, according to the National Sleep Foundation. One aim of cognitive behavioral therapy is to pinpoint actions that may be prohibiting sleep, and thus develop a customized list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for optimal \u201csleep hygiene.\u201d\n\nPhoto: iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nSome are obvious, like sleeping in a cool, dark room, and avoiding caffeine, alcohol and tobacco before bedtime. (Contrary to popular belief, alcohol is a deterrent to a sound sleep.) Others are more ingenious: To avoid literally watching the sleepless hours go by, hide the clock.\n\nRelaxation training can help as well, including yoga, and techniques to relax muscles from the feet to the face.\n\nOnce patients are dependent on sleep drugs, going cold turkey can just make things worse, says Sean Jeffrey, director of clinical pharmacy services at Hartford Healthcare and a clinical professor at the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy. He advises patients on a tapering-off schedule \u201cso it doesn\u2019t feel like you are ripping off a band-aid.\u201d\n\nDr. Jeffrey encourages patients to exercise and get outdoors in bright morning sunlight to help set the body\u2019s clock for sleep in the evening.\n\nMs. Landro, a Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor, writes the Informed Patient column.
