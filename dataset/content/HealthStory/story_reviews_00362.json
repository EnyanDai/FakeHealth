She now has eight locations in New York, Florida and Israel. The Brooklyn salon, opened in April, has big boxes of lollipops and Twizzlers. Cartoons playing on a TV screen are interrupted by the constant ring of the phone and chatter of schoolchildren. A lice check at a local private school one day last week had brought a steady stream of business.\n\nSome six million to 12 million infestations of head lice occur each year in the U.S. in children ages 3 to 11 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Despite experts\u2019 assurances that head lice pose no health concern, the insects are a regular source of angst for schools and families, who may spend as much as hundreds of dollars to get rid of them.\n\nAn enlarged view of Pediculus humanus--a human head louse.

While such products are still recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups as the first line of treatment, some doctors and parents are turning to new topical treatments, which are generally available by prescription. Also getting a boost are combing salons, some of which have expanded into multistate chains.\n\n\u201cThe process of combing out is the only way to get rid of all the lice and nits,\u201d says Deborah Capone, who calls in Lice Busters\u2019 employees when there is a lice outbreak at the three preschools she runs in Brooklyn.\n\nThe salons typically use a technique known as wet combing. Hair is doused in some sort of lubricant\u2014often Pantene conditioner\u2014and employees use a specially designed comb to remove the lice and nits. The conditioner loosens the pests and makes them easier to spot. The process can take more than an hour as hair is combed multiple times from different angles.\n\nLice Busters\u2019 Ms. Harel says her two New York locations charge $20 for an initial check and $150 to $250 for a treatment, depending on hair length and how severe the infestation is. A recheck a week later is another $20. Employees also do house calls.\n\nCustomers at the Brooklyn salon say they come there to avoid applying chemicals on their children\u2019s heads. \u201cWe can leave here relieved,\u201d says one mom.\n\nKarin Kutasewich, owner of Lice Squad in Toronto, Ontario, works to remove lice from a customer\u2019s hair. Adding conditioner makes the hair easier to comb through.

By comparison, there were 42 such companies in 2009 when she published a book that detailed her method of nit removal. Ms. Shepherd also heads a company that tests lice products and she operates three lice-combing salons.\n\nSome experts criticize lice-combing businesses because they aren\u2019t regulated. People who work in the salons tend to have no particular training in pest control or entomology, says Richard J. Pollack, a senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University. And most aren\u2019t able to distinguish between debris and dandruff, and between a nit, a louse and some other kind of bug, says Dr. Pollack, who also runs a consulting business called IdentifyUS LLC that identifies bug specimens, mainly bed bugs and ticks, and offers guidance on managing pest problems.\n\nNewer prescription treatments have been shown to be safe and effective, and to have no serious side effects, according to an article published online in the journal Pediatric Dermatology last week that reviewed studies of the products. The effectiveness of traditional over-the-counter shampoos has dropped to about 25% from nearly 100% two decades ago, the researchers say. \u201cWidespread and indiscriminate use\u201d of the traditional products and mutations in lice made them resistant to the insecticides, they say.\n\nThe prescription products include benzyl alcohol, sold under the brand name Ulesfia; ivermectin, or Sklice; malathion, or Ovide lotion; and spinosad, sold as Natroba. The medications have been found to be from 68% to 87% effective after one or two applications. Most don\u2019t require combing.\n\nThe review article\u2019s authors, some of whom have consulted with pharmaceutical companies, also say there is no evidence for the effectiveness of some popular home remedies for lice, including dousing the hair in olive oil, petroleum jelly, mayonnaise or essential oils, practices that could also be unsafe.\n\n\u201cWe thought it was time to review some of these newer products so people would understand what control options they have,\u201d says John Clark, a professor of environmental toxicology and chemistry at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and a co-author on the study.\n\nHaving multiple treatment options is important to help prevent the rapid development of resistance again, says Dr. Clark, whose research has documented the development of the mutations in lice believed to have contributed to their resistance to over-the-counter treatments. Dr. Clark says he has worked as a consultant for some of the companies that developed the prescription treatments, but has no current active research projects.\n\n\u201cMy guidance would be that the first step should be to contact a physician and ask for a visit and prescription,\u201d says William Ryan, another co-author on the Pediatric Dermatology article. Dr. Ryan says he previously ran the development program for the company that created Sklice. He works as a consultant in the pharmaceutical industry but isn\u2019t currenlty working for any companies with lice products.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics and some other medical associations, including the National Association of School Nurses, still recommend OTC shampoos as the first line of treatment for lice unless resistance has been documented in a community.\n\nThe OTC treatments sometimes don\u2019t seem to work because the lice diagnosis wasn\u2019t accurate or the products aren\u2019t used properly or the patient became reinfected, says Dawn Nolt, clinical associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Doernbecher Children\u2019s Hospital in Portland, Ore.\n\nWhile the prescription drugs are effective, they are more expensive, says Dr. Nolt, who is on the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that developed last year\u2019s updated lice recommendations. Prescription lice medications can cost as much as $300 and aren\u2019t always covered by insurance.\n\nNatasha Burgert, a pediatrician in Kansas City, Mo., recommends parents first try the over-the-counter lice treatments because they are inexpensive and will still work in certain regions of the country. If those aren\u2019t effective after one or two days, she suggests a prescription medication or occasionally oral antibiotics in combination with an OTC treatment.\n\n\u201cSome parents don\u2019t like to do the prescriptions because they think it\u2019s more chemicals on their kid\u2019s skin,\u201d Dr. Burgert says. As for a combing salon, \u201cIt\u2019s a nice option and it certainly gets the job done. It\u2019s just very, very tedious.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com", "images": ["https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg",
