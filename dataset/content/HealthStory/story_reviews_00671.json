And in other tests the app asks users to decide whether the letter \"E\" is facing up, down, right or left.\n\n\u201cYour eye is sending your brain a blurry image, but because your brain has gone through this training, it\u2019s capable of processing much lower quality images,\u201d Starr said.\n\nThe company says the app is scientifically tested. In a small study published in Nature's Scientific Reports, 90 percent of participants gained the ability to read comfortably without glasses.\n\nBut not all experts are sold on the app\u2019s training method.\n\n\u201cThe proposed theory of explanation behind the GlassesOff technology seems to imply that the resolution of the captured image of the eye and its more central processing by the brain can be improved upon, with \u2018learning\u2019. The idea that these low level changes can translate into higher visual performance that is clinically meaningful to a patient is yet to be demonstrated in any randomized clinical trial,\u201d Dr. Barrett Katz, a neuro-opthamologist at New York\u2019s Montefiore Medical Center, told FoxNews.com\n\nThe app is free to download, but the basic 3-month program costs $25. The company suggests following their \u201cOngoing Vision Care program\u201d in order to keep the benefits indefinitely. For the life-long option, you can subscribe for $9.99 a month or pay $59.99 for the year.\n\nFor more information go to GlassesOff.com.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150301051757im_/http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-801796h&cg=0&cc=1&si=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/26/app-trains-your-brain-to-see-better/&ts=noscript&rnd=1425187029723", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150301051757im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/futuristic_eye_640.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150301051757im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9013181&c3=&c4=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/26/app-trains-your-brain-to-see-better/&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.2&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150301051757im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/876/493/futuristic_eye_640.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150301051757im_/http://metrics.foxnews.com/b/ss/foxnews/1/H22.1--NS/1425187029723?pageName=noscript:health:front:article&g=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/26/app-trains-your-brain-to-see-better/"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150301051757im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/futuristic_eye_640.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Carlton"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150301051757/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/26/app-trains-your-brain-to-see-better/", "title": "App \u2018trains\u2019 your brain to see better", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "App \u2018trains\u2019 your brain to see better", "dc.creator": "Lindsay Carlton", "description": "Developing vision problems is a natural part of aging.
