The tightly packed network of cells in brain capillaries only lets certain substances through, such as key nutrients, making brain-based disorders difficult to treat with drugs.\n\n1 Million The number of Americans with Parkinson's disease, a progressive, degenerative brain disorder with no cure.\n\nMedtronic, the largest stand-alone medical-device maker, already has a handful of other Parkinson's collaborations underway. The company is also working through home-grown efforts and collaborations on potential treatments for other brain diseases, like Alzheimer's and Huntington's.\n\nThe latest effort with Lilly is still many years from yielding a marketable treatment or even starting human testing. The companies didn't disclose terms of their agreement, but a Medtronic spokesman said it spans early research through product development and potential commercialization.\n\nParkinson's is a progressive, degenerative brain disorder that affects nearly one million Americans and can lead to tremors and other movement problems, according to the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. The disease, which has no cure, is thought to be caused by the death of neurons that produce the important chemical messenger dopamine. Lilly's treatment approach involves a modified form of a protein called glial cell derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, which is designed to protect these neurons.\n\nSeven years ago, Amgen Inc. stopped studying a potential GDNF Parkinson's treatment delivered with Medtronic equipment because it didn't appear effective. But Lilly hopes its compound, together with Medtronic's modernized delivery system, will \"overcome some prior technical hurdles,\" said Ros Smith, senior research director of regenerative biology at Lilly. The company believes its GDNF variant has potential to have broader distribution in the brain than prior versions.\n\nThe drug may not enter human clinical trials for up to five years, Dr. Smith said.\n\nMedtronic's system involves small catheters that are implanted in the brain and connected to a hockey-puck-size pump, which would likely be implanted in the abdomen. At this point it isn't known whether the treatment would involve short- or long-term infusion, or what specific areas of the brain might be targeted, said Steve Oesterle, senior vice president of medicine and technology at Medtronic.\n\nThe company already has experience finding and delivering treatment to parts of the brain responsible for Parkinson's through its \"deep-brain stimulation\" business, which makes pacemaker-like implants that deliver electrical stimulation through electrodes. That approach is used to treat Parkinson's symptoms, Dr. Oesterle said. By contrast, drug approaches from Lilly and other companies have potential to restore damaged parts of the brain, he said.\n\nThe key is getting the drugs on site, rather than having them circulate through the body only to be stymied by the blood-brain barrier.\n\nMedtronic also has partnerships with small drug developers Neurologix Inc. and privately held NeuroNova AB of Sweden on potential Parkinson's treatments.\n\n\u2014Peter Loftus and Matt Jarzemsky contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@dowjones.com", "images":
