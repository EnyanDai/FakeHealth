Goldstein, co-director of the Bone Densitometry and Body Composition unit at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. In an abstract of a 50-person study presented in October at the annual meeting of the North American Menopause Society, researchers found that 18.5% of the women with normal BMI actually had significant excess fat as measured on DXA, making them \u201cskinny fat\u201d people, says Dr. Goldstein, who co-wrote the paper. Also, some women flagged by BMI as overweight actually had normal levels of fat, he says.\n\nFor people trying to lose fat and gain muscle through diet, exercise and resistance training, the X-ray scan \u201ctakes the guesswork\u201d out figuring how well you\u2019re doing, says Param Dedhia, a physician at Canyon Ranch, a spa in Tucson, Ariz., that offers the scans. Clients typically get the scans between three months and two years apart to measure progress, he says.\n\nA DXA scan (pronounced dexa) is commonly used to measure bone density, but recently has been increasingly used to measure body composition. The scan takes three to 12 minutes, depending on the type of machine and your body size.\n\nThe cost, $45 to $350 or more, generally isn\u2019t covered by insurance. It is available at a growing number of spas, hospitals and doctor\u2019s offices, says Tom Webb, global product marketing manager, body-composition, for General Electric Co. \u2019s GE Healthcare unit, which makes two popular scanners.\n\nAfter the scan, you get a report with the mass of your bones, fat and lean tissue (including organs and muscle) broken out individually. Your body-fat percentage is also listed and can be compared with reference values for Americans. The report also shows the amount of fat and lean tissue in each body part, such as the right arm or left leg\u2014information that can be helpful for athletes to see if an injured limb is regaining muscle, says John A. Shepherd, director of the Body Composition, Exercise Physiology and Energy Metabolism laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco.\n\nBoth of GE\u2019s machines, the Lunar iDXA and Lunar Prodigy, and Hologic\u2019s Horizon DXA estimate how much visceral fat you have, a measure that can help predict risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, says Dr. Shepherd, whose lab has received research funding from both companies. (Dr. Shepherd also worked as principal scientist at Hologic from 1996 to 1999 but has no direct financial relationship currently, he says.)\n\nAmong methods now available for measuring body composition, DXA \u201cwould rank among the top,\u201d says Dympna Gallagher, director of the body composition laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. It is more accurate than water weighing, long used by researchers to estimate body-fat mass, and more reliable than bioimpedance, a method found on some home scales, and pinching a fold of skin with calipers, she adds.\n\nDXA is reliable when measuring progress over time, Dr. Shepherd says. It is important to use the same model of machine when comparing scans, as results vary slightly among them.\n\nGE Healthcare\u2019s Lunar iDXA system for whole-body scans. Photo: GE Healthcare\n\nA 2013 study published in the Journal of Clinical Densitometry by researchers at USCF and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only small differences when the same 600 people were scanned and rescanned between three and 51 days later. For fat mass, for example, the machine was precise within about a pound in either direction.\n\nScanning too often will show incremental changes and the results won\u2019t be meaningful, says British researcher Susan Hopkins a lecturer in medical imaging at the University of Exeter Medical School.\n\nHow often to scan depends on how fast you are making progress. An obese person on a crash diet might see a large change worth measuring fairly soon, for example, while an elderly person slowly building muscle mass through resistance training might progress slowly, and therefore need less frequent scans, Dr. Hopkins says.\n\nDXA scans involve a small amount of radiation, generally between less than 1 and 10 microsieverts, Dr. Shepherd says. That is only a fraction of a chest X-ray, which ranges from 50 to 150 microsieverts, or a mammogram, at about 400, and is about the same as one day of background radiation, he says.\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of the chart on median body fat percentages contained incorrect figures.", "images": ["https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/fddd6d28f0576a5772474e644a95623747e1cb4b.jpg?5dc9ac40", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/b5e977a5139ed9e9684742f90919df7b635ae623.jpg?5dc9aba2", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/0d2ffa0d6fff89f02d5a9d5508d5467ad9dbd858.jpg?5dc9aba1", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/487b80633438bb2d561829c2e7f8bccee2c45e0b.jpg?5dc9ab9e", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/2a7d0786567f18bb6a72f17019cd642c0b51f730.jpg?5dc9aba1", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/93d4c0693749e5d6abc5f87d798d3bfdb580948b.jpg?5dc995fd", "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746?width=111&height=62", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JW669_0818ac_H_20150817113910.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/f600b0a56ee84a4d350fa4e522e51ee27d5fd426.jpg?5dc9aba3", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125154?width=111&height=62", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/461b35da8a2936ee4a7ca01072773c0d5aa427f2.jpg?5dc9aba4", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/869c2a340c4c25db5466a6de556da60ae1a2bf4e.jpg?5dc9aba2", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/4a581253a775cca47f02b15ba756a5f4ccf7b8bf.jpg?5dc969b8", "https://images.wsj.net/im-124802?width=111&height=62", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JW632_0817ac_G_20150817105701.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JW632_0817ac_8S_20150817105701.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JW632_0817ac_D_20150817105701.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-CC993B_ACHES_16U_20150817141205.jpg"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JW632_0817ac_G_20150817105701.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Johannes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/too-much-fat-try-a-whole-body-scan-1439828879", "title": "Too Much Fat?
