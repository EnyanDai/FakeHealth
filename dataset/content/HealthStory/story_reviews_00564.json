This version has been corrected.\n\nA small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other forms of dementia.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non\u00adinvasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain\u2019s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer\u2019s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.\n\n[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s disease]\n\n\u201cLook, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,\u201d said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. \u201cWhat we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.\u201d\n\nMore than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer\u2019s, a person\u2019s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.\n\nDuffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people\u2019s memory and ability to think.\n\nWith Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.\n\n\u201cAll perception is interpretive, and so what we\u2019re doing is measuring that process,\u201d Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.\n\nCerebral Assessment Systems\u2019 device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.\n\nThe Pittsford, N.Y.-based company\u2019s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).\n\nThe device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.\n\nLinda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.\n\nBut her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it\u2019s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a really potentially valuable tool,\u201d said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.\n\nAlgase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE. But she said it\u2019s more convenient and less time-consuming to administer.", "images": ["http://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Fredrick Kunkle", "General Assignment Reporting", "August"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/fda-approves-marketing-of-convenient-tool-to-diagnose-dementia/2015/08/10/fe34689e-3d47-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "title": "FDA approves tool for diagnosing dementia in a doctor\u2019s office", "meta_data": {"eomportal-uuid": "fe34689e-3d47-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48", "object-hash": 1573407197, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": "Alzheimer's, dementia, diagnosis, University of Rochester, MMSE, Mini-Mental State Exam, Charles Duffy, Cerebral Assessment Systems", "news_keywords": "Alzheimer's, dementia, diagnosis, University of Rochester, MMSE, Mini-Mental State Exam, Charles Duffy, Cerebral Assessment Systems", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KunkleFredrick"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/fda-approves-marketing-of-convenient-tool-to-diagnose-dementia/2015/08/10/fe34689e-3d47-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "title": "FDA approves tool for diagnosing dementia in a doctor\u2019s office", "description": "Rochester University neurologist develops computer game-like device to assess cognitive ability."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/freddy.kunkle"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "ansId": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/fda-approves-marketing-of-convenient-tool-to-diagnose-dementia/2015/08/10/fe34689e-3d47-11e5-9c2d-ed991d848c48_story.html", "description": "Rochester University neurologist develops computer game-like device to assess cognitive ability.", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/freddy.kunkle"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1439179200.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
