controlling the heavy menstrual bleeding they often cause, according to new research from Europe.\n\nIn one study, the drug ulipristal acetate proved to be much more effective than a placebo for shrinking the non-malignant uterine tumors.\n\nIn another, ulipristal acetate was found to be as effective as monthly injections of the drug Lupron for reducing heavy bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.\n\nBoth studies appear in the Feb. 2 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nUlipristal acetate is the active chemical in the emergency contraceptive sold in the U.S. as Ella, but the daily doses taken by the fibroid patients in the studies were much smaller than those in the contraceptive.\n\nIf trials now under way in the U.S. prove positive, New Jersey-based Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Swiss-based PregLem hope to market ulipristal acetate as a fibroid treatment under the trade name Esmya, says Watson spokesman Charlie Mayr.", "images":
