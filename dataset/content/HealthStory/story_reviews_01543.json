The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.\n\nDigital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate \u2014 or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.\n\nBiopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.\n\nAnd prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.\n\nThe Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer.\n\nLightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test.\n\nCrawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies.\n\n\u201cIt reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cIf you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55.\u201d\n\nThe test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did. This compares to just 21 percent for PSA alone, the researchers told a meeting of the American Urological Association in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIf the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,\u201d Crawford said.\n\nThe test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.\n\nAmong the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer.\n\nThe test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Fox", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-test-idUSTRE6505ZS20100601", "title": "Urine test improves prostate diagnosis: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "A urine test can help doctors better spot prostate cancer than either the current blood test or a rectal exam alone, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.", "Author": "Maggie Fox", "keywords": "United States,Sandra Maler,David Crawford,Maggie Fox,US,CANCER,PROSTATE,TEST", "news_keywords": "United States;Sandra Maler;David Crawford;Maggie Fox;US;CANCER;PROSTATE;TEST", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Jun 01 20:19:55 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-06-01T20:19:55+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Maggie Fox", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-test-idUSTRE6505ZS20100601", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Urine test improves prostate diagnosis: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Sandra Maler,David Crawford,Maggie Fox,US,CANCER,PROSTATE,TEST", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-PROSTATE-TEST", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Urine test improves prostate diagnosis: study", "sailthru.author": "Maggie Fox", "sailthru.date": "2010-06-01T20:19:55+0000", "sailthru.title": "Urine test improves prostate diagnosis: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Urine test improves prostate diagnosis: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-test-idUSTRE6505ZS20100601", "type": "article", "description": "A urine test can help doctors better spot prostate cancer than either the curren...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-06-01T20:19:55+0000", "modified_time": "2010-06-01T20:19:55+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Maggie Fox", "tag": "United States,Sandra Maler,David Crawford,Maggie Fox,US,CANCER,PROSTATE,TEST"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Urine test improves prostate diagnosis: study", "description": "A urine test can help doctors better spot prostate cancer than either the current blood test or a rectal exam alone, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1275423595.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
