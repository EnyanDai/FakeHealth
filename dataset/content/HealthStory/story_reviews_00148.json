The devices are lifesaving when used to open arteries in patients in the throes of a heart attack.\n\nBut they are most often used in patients who have a blocked artery and chest pain that occurs, for example, walking up a hill or going up stairs. Sometimes patients get stents when they have no pain at all, just blockages.\n\nHeart disease is still the leading killer of Americans \u2014 790,000 people have heart attacks each year \u2014 and stenting is a mainstay treatment in virtually every hospital. More than 500,000 heart patients worldwide have stents inserted each year to relieve chest pain, according to the researchers. Other estimates are far higher.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03STENT1/03STENT1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03STENT1/03STENT1-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03STENT1/03STENT1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html", "title": "\u2018Unbelievable\u2019: Heart Stents Fail to Ease Chest Pain", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-11-02T15:51:12.000Z", "modified": "2017-11-03T01:05:37.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/gina-kolata", "tag": "Surgery and Surgeons", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005529597, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/41b087e5-5633-54fe-9703-c565236a374c", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/9468903962d44eb6a97ff9da528809ec", "description": "With a sham treatment, British researchers found that a common and often costly cardiac procedure does not relieve discomfort.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03STENT1/03STENT1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Gina Kolata", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03STENT1/03STENT1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Stents,Angina pectoris,Heart,Preventive medicine,Medical device,Surgery", "pdate": 20171102, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Unbelievable\u2019: Heart Stents Fail to Ease Chest Pain", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03STENT1/03STENT1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "A new study has found that while stents can be lifesaving in opening arteries in patients having a heart attack, the devices are ineffective in relieving chest pain."}, "description": "With a sham treatment, British researchers found that a common and often costly cardiac procedure does not relieve discomfort."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html", "title": "\u2018Unbelievable\u2019: Heart Stents Fail to Ease Chest Pain", "description": "With a sham treatment, British researchers found that a common and often costly cardiac procedure does not relieve discomfort.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03STENT1/03STENT1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "A new study has found that while stents can be lifesaving in opening arteries in patients having a heart attack, the devices are ineffective in relieving chest pain."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005529597"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005529597", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/health/heart-disease-stents.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509595200.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
