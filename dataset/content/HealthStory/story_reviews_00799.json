But people looking to lose a few pounds may not want to go running to the produce aisle just yet. Scientists say there are no major human studies to support the idea that a berry holds the secret to weight loss.\n\nSome new weight-loss supplements, such as one from Swanson Health Products, center, use the Razberi-K brand of raspberry ketones, while others mix the ketones with substances, such as Reserveage Organics's Green Coffee Bean Extract, second from left.\n\nRaspberry ketones, the organic compounds that give raspberries their aroma, raised hopes as a weight-loss aid after a 2005 study by Japanese researchers found the ketones boosted fat-burning processes in rat cells in a laboratory as long as those cells were also exposed to a hormone known to help break up fat. The study, funded by a Japanese company developing a diet product no longer on the market, found that mice fed a high-fat diet plus raspberry ketones gained less weight than mice fed the high fat diet alone.\n\nSince you'd have to eat a lot of raspberries to consume even a small amount of ketones, the compounds are being sold in a number of new weight-loss supplements. Some of the products use ketones extracted from real raspberries. Often they are synthetically manufactured in a laboratory, as is Razberi-K, a branded form of raspberry ketones sold by FHG Corp., in Spring Hill, Tenn., and used in about 30 companies' products.\n\n\"Razberi-K is perfect for those seeking stimulant-free support for a healthy weight-management program,\" says the website of Swanson Health Products Inc. in Fargo, N.D., which uses FHG's ingredient in its raspberry-ketone dietary supplement. The capsules, which went on sale last year, cost $3.79 for a month's supply of 100-milligram capsules taken twice daily, the company says.\n\nThe growing popularity of raspberry ketones comes despite no major human published studies. \"There is inadequate human data to support the idea that [raspberry ketones] actually cause weight loss,\" say Louis J. Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight-Control Program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York. Substances that cause weight loss in mice rarely end up working in humans, he adds.\n\nNatural Standard Research Collaboration is a scientist-owned group that evaluates natural therapies. In a recently-updated review, it gave raspberry ketones for weight loss a grade of \"C,\" which means the scientific evidence is unclear. \"It has not been well studied or well proven in the data we've uncovered to this point,\" says Catherine Ulbricht, co-founder of the Cambridge, Mass., group.\n\nA study published by a Korean researcher in 2010 found adding raspberry ketones to fat cells in a laboratory stimulated production of adiponectin\u2014touted by some companies as a fat burner. It is true that adiponectin is a beneficial protein, says University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center scientist Philipp E. Scherer, but its main known benefits are reducing the risk of diabetes and helping to redistribute fat away from unhealthy areas, such as the liver and belly.\n\nSo far adiponectin doesn't seem helpful in weight loss, he adds, and in fact studies of mice genetically altered to make more adiponectin showed the animals actually gained weight. That doesn't mean humans will gain weight if they make more adiponectin. \"The idea that it would actually cause weight loss is probably incorrect,\" says Dr. Scherer.\n\nThe Japanese study states that the chemical structure of raspberry ketones is similar to synephrine, a stimulant. For this reason people with cardiac issues or high blood pressure should avoid them, says Dr. Aronne.\n\nTim Ziegenfuss, who conducted a 10-person monthlong human safety study of Razberi-K, says there were no side effects and none of the subjects reported feeling jittery. Dr. Ziegenfuss declined to provide a copy of the study's results for this column. FHG, which funded the study and does business as Integrity Nutraceuticals, also declined to provide a copy. The company says adiponectin is only \"one part of the complex puzzle\" and shouldn't be used to determine if the product is effective. FHG said it has had no customer complaints of stimulant-like side effects.\n\nThe Japanese study used synthetic ketones, according to study lead author Chie Morimoto, an associate professor at Matsuyama Shinonome Junior College in Japan. But several companies use natural ketones as a selling point. Simply Raspberry Ketones, a product from JJSmith Group Inc.'s aProvenProduct.com unit, contains the \"purest natural\" ketones and sells for a suggested retail price of $68 for a month's supply of 500 milligram capsules, according to the company's website.\n\nSeveral companies mix raspberry ketones with other natural weight-loss remedies that have been studied more. \"We're encouraged\" by the raspberry ketone research, says Rob Maru, president of innovation and brand development at Reserveage Organics LLC, in Gainesville, Fla., but \"as a stand-alone it doesn't comply with our standards\" for sufficient human research. The company's Advanced Solutions Green Coffee Bean Extract with raspberry ketones, costs $34.99 for a month's supply.\n\n\u2014Email aches@wsj.com", "images": ["https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/fddd6d28f0576a5772474e644a95623747e1cb4b.jpg?5dc9ac40", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/b5e977a5139ed9e9684742f90919df7b635ae623.jpg?5dc9aba2", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/0d2ffa0d6fff89f02d5a9d5508d5467ad9dbd858.jpg?5dc9aba1", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/487b80633438bb2d561829c2e7f8bccee2c45e0b.jpg?5dc9ab9e", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BK488_ACHES_P_20121029181031.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/93d4c0693749e5d6abc5f87d798d3bfdb580948b.jpg?5dc995fd", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746?width=111&height=62", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/f600b0a56ee84a4d350fa4e522e51ee27d5fd426.jpg?5dc9aba3", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-125154?width=111&height=62", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BK488_ACHES_D_20121029181031.jpg", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/461b35da8a2936ee4a7ca01072773c0d5aa427f2.jpg?5dc9aba4", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/2a7d0786567f18bb6a72f17019cd642c0b51f730.jpg?5dc9b0a0", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/869c2a340c4c25db5466a6de556da60ae1a2bf4e.jpg?5dc9aba2", "https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/4a581253a775cca47f02b15ba756a5f4ccf7b8bf.jpg?5dc969b8", "https://images.wsj.net/im-124802?width=111&height=62", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BK488_ACHES_G_20121029181031.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BK488_ACHES_G_20121029181031.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Johannes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204840504578084811010354082", "title": "The Berry Essence of Fat Burning?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dj.asn": "i-0ac0", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "page.section": "Article", "page.content.type": "Article", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online", "article.template": "full", "page.site": "wsj", "page.site.product": "WSJ", "page.region": "na,us", "article.id": "SB10001424052970204840504578084811010354082", "article.type": "Aches & Claims", "article.type.display": "Aches & Claims", "article.access": "paid", "article.headline": "The Berry Essence of Fat Burning?", "article.summary": "A compound in raspberries is being touted as the next new fat burner.
