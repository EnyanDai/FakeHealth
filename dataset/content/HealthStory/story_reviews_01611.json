Pfizer last week announced a deal with Canadian biotech Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp for this type of delivery vehicle for its RNAi drugs, joining Roche and Alnylam.\n\nIn the approach used by Davis and colleagues, once the particles find the cancer cell and get inside, they break down, releasing small interfering RNAs or siRNAs that block a gene that makes a cancer growth protein called ribonucleotide reductase.\n\n\u201cIn the particle itself, we\u2019ve built what we call a chemical sensor,\u201d Davis said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhen it recognizes that it\u2019s gone inside the cell, it says OK, now it\u2019s time to disassemble and give off the RNA.\u201d\n\nIn a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with various types of tumors, the team gave doses of the targeted nanoparticles four times over 21 days in a 30-minute intravenous infusion.\n\nTumor samples taken from three people with melanoma showed the nanoparticles found their way inside tumor cells.\n\nAnd they found evidence that the therapy had disabled ribonucleotide reductase, suggesting the RNA had done its job.\n\nDavis could not say whether the therapy helped shrink tumors in the patients, but one patient did get a second cycle of treatment, suggesting it might be. Nor could he say if there were any safety concerns.\n\nDavis said that part of the study will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-rnai-idUSTRE62K1BK20100321", "title": "Nanotech robots deliver gene therapy through blood", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "U.S. researchers have developed tiny nanoparticle robots that can travel through a patient's blood and into tumors where they deliver a therapy that turns off an important cancer gene.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "US,CANCER,RNAI", "news_keywords": "US;CANCER;RNAI", "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Mar 21 18:08:47 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-03-21T18:08:47+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-rnai-idUSTRE62K1BK20100321", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Nanotech robots deliver gene therapy through blood", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,CANCER,RNAI", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-RNAI", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Nanotech robots deliver gene therapy through blood", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2010-03-21T18:08:47+0000", "sailthru.title": "Nanotech robots deliver gene therapy through blood", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Nanotech robots deliver gene therapy through blood", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-rnai-idUSTRE62K1BK20100321", "type": "article", "description": "U.S. researchers have developed tiny nanoparticle robots that can travel through...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-03-21T18:08:47+0000", "modified_time": "2010-03-21T18:08:47+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "US,CANCER,RNAI"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Nanotech robots deliver gene therapy through blood", "description": "U.S. researchers have developed tiny nanoparticle robots that can travel through a patient's blood and into tumors where they deliver a therapy that turns off an important cancer gene.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1269194927.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
