In fact, 7.4 million women ages 15 to 44 have used infertility services in their lifetimes.\n\nPamela\u2019s doctors said her fallopian tubes were blocked and that her only options to get pregnant would be with surgery or in vitro fertilization (IVF)\u2014 options Pamela did not want to try.\n\n\u201cI hate needles, and I didn\u2019t want to go through all the emotions and the hormone shots,\u201d said Pamela, who added that her health insurance would have paid for three IVF cycles.\n\nAdhesions\u2014 which are comprised of internal scar tissue that forms after surgery, infection or trauma\u2014 can cause fallopian tubes to become blocked. And if the mucus that lines the tubes is too thick, this can also contribute to blockage. When one or both tubes are blocked, the egg cannot travel to the uterus and the sperm cannot reach the egg.\n\n\u201cAfter they told me that I would have to do IVF, I started looking for natural ways to solve infertility,\u201d Soto said.\n\nBy doing a quick Google search, Pamela and her husband, John Henry Soto, found Clear Passage, a physical therapy clinic in Gainesville, Fla., that treats certain causes of female infertility like blocked fallopian tubes, endometriosis and hormonal dysfunction.\n\nClear Passage therapists use their hands to soften and massage away adhesions blocking the tubes.\n\n\"We feel and we check all the organs in the abdomen and the pelvis, and wherever we feel that tissues or organs won't move in a certain direction with our hands, we\u2019ll stretch them [in that direction], and we\u2019ll hold that stretch until the tissues and adhesions start to deform and give way,\" Belinda Wurn, a physical therapist and co-developer of the Clear Passage treatment, told FoxNews.com.\n\nPhysical therapists administer the deep massage-like therapy over five days and 20 hours total.\n\n\u201cIt was an uncomfortable pressure,\u201d Pamela said. \u201cI wouldn't describe it as a massage at all. It was like physical therapy\u2014 it didn't hurt, but it wasn't a good feeling either.\"\n\nIn a retrospective study of 1,392 infertile women, published in the journal Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine, the treatment showed a 60 percent success rate in opening at least one fallopian tube and a 57 percent pregnancy rate for women whose tubes have opened.\n\n\"We have enough data on enough patients to where we feel were statistically significant in opening blocked tubes, treating endometriosis and treating elevated follicle stimulating hormone,\" Dr. Richard King, a gynecologist and the medical director for Clear Passage Physical Therapy, told FoxNews.com.\n\nEight months after Pamela received therapy at Clear Passage, she discovered she was pregnant. She wrapped her positive pregnancy test in a box and surprised her husband with the news on Father\u2019s Day.\n\n\"I can\u2019t even imagine not having (our daughter) Brianna in our lives right now. She\u2019s just brought so much joy to our lives,\" John Henry Soto told FoxNews.com\n\nIn case the Sotos want to try for a second child, King says their therapy has shown long-lasting results.\n\n\u201cWe found that this treatment probably lasts a long period of time because we\u2019ve had a lot of patients with blocked fallopian tubes that we\u2019ve done this 20-hour protocol to that have had more than one child,\u201d King said.\n\nAlthough the founders tout the therapy\u2019s success, some fertility experts have expressed skepticism over their findings.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about a retrospective report, you\u2019re saying, \u2018OK, we treated these people, and these are our results.\u2019 And that\u2019s interesting, and their results were good in some sections, but it's not scientific in the sense of a prospective, randomized, controlled study,\u201d Dr. Joel Batzofin, a fertility specialist at New York Fertility Services, a part of ARC fertility, told FoxNews.com. \u201cThey [the patients] were not stratified by disease type, by age, by duration of infertility, by body weight, smokers versus non-smokers, ever pregnant versus never pregnant, male factors\u2014 these are all things that have a profound bearing on results.\u201d\n\nAlthough Batzofin pointed out the importance of further study, he said the therapy may a be useful option for some patients.\n\n\u201cThere are women that produce mucus of a thick viscus quality, and it sticks and lodges in there. The fallopian tube at the uterine end is very narrow and it gets blocked in there, so it\u2019s quite easy to imagine that a course of physical therapy is going to soften this up, dislodge it and clear the passage,\u201d Batzofin said.\n\nBatzofin added that compared to surgery or IVF, the side effects are minimal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be harmful,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one has to be careful about raising false expectations.\u201d\n\nThe Clear Passage therapy costs around $6,000, and some insurance plans may cover it.\n\nFor more information, visit
