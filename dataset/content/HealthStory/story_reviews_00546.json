In fact, the physician has wagered a few good bottles of champagne that none of three large randomized trials now underway will find proof of positive effects.\n\nTo Autier, a researcher at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences in Glasgow, Scotland, the widespread faith in vitamin D\u2019s benefits is like a religion. \u201cPeople want to have a simple story they can believe in,\u201d he says.\n\nCedric Garland, meanwhile, hews just as strongly to the opposite view \u2014 that vitamin D supplements confer a slew of benefits, including warding off colon cancer, breast cancer, even Type 1 diabetes.\n\n\u201cThe science is, in my opinion, unassailable,\u201d says Garland, an adjunct professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s just preposterous to say it\u2019s not proven.\u201d\n\nIn January 2014, Autier published a statistical analysis of results from hundreds of studies of vitamin D. He concluded: \u201cUnfortunately, there is probably no benefit to expect from vitamin D supplementation in normally healthy people.\u201d\n\nGarland, on the other hand, is the co-author of dozens of studies showing a strong, inverse association between vitamin D levels and seemingly every disease under the sun. Indeed, sun exposure is Garland\u2019s explanation for why rates of cancer, Type 1 diabetes and other diseases tend to be higher the farther people live from the equator. Vitamin D, after all, is the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d synthesized from cholesterol in the skin in response to sunlight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mathematical relationship,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe higher your latitude and the greater your area\u2019s average cloud cover, the higher your rates of cancer.\u201d Since he and his late brother, Frank Garland, published the first study, in 1980, revealing that relationship, hundreds of other studies have explored the link between vitamin D, including supplements, and health \u2014 but none were large enough, long enough or designed well enough to convince the skeptics.\n\nNow three nationally recognized researchers are leading landmark studies designed to settle at least some of the questions about vitamin D once and for all. The one thing the research leaders are certain of is that the public\u2019s faith in vitamin D as a modern panacea has far outpaced what the scientific evidence proves.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a rush to judgment on vitamin D,\u201d says JoAnn E. Manson, chief of the division of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u201cEveryone has gotten on the bandwagon. Unfortunately, the lessons of history have shown repeatedly that many of these supplements that appeared to be very promising did not pan out in more rigorous testing.\u201d\n\nManson should know. She has led or collaborated on more than a dozen large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, dating back more than two decades, which found none of the expected protection against cancer, heart disease, dementia or other diseases that scientists once attributed to beta carotene, vitamin E or vitamin C supplements. (She did find, however, that supplementation with folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 offered modest protection against age-related macular degeneration and, for those with a diet low in B vitamins to begin with, a hint of protection against the loss of cognitive abilities.)\n\nNow Manson is co-directing the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial (VITAL), testing whether, compared with placebo, a daily supplement of either 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or one gram of fish oil (another widely touted substance) reduces the risk of stroke, cancer, heart disease and other health problems. The five-year study, involving 25,874 men and women, is scheduled to end in October 2017.\n\nAnother trial is testing whether a daily supplement of 4,000 IU of vitamin D will prevent Type 2 diabetes. The so-called D2d study, which will run for four years, is seeking to enroll 2,382 people older than 30 who are at high risk of developing diabetes due to weight or blood-sugar levels but who have not yet been diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\u201cI would call myself an optimistic skeptic,\u201d says Anastasios Pittas, principal investigator of the D2d study and a professor of medicine at Tufts School of Medicine in Boston. \u201cThe indirect evidence is very strong. People with higher levels of vitamin D in their blood have been shown again and again to have a lower risk of developing diabetes in the future. These studies are as consistent as we have ever seen with any nutrient.\u201d\n\nBut, he adds, \u201cthose studies do not prove cause and effect. Before we make a blanket recommendation for the 86 million people in the United States who are at risk for Type 2 diabetes to go out and buy vitamin D supplements, we need to know for sure if they help.\u201d\n\nA third trial, designed to test whether 5,000 IU of vitamin D per day will slow the progression of multiple sclerosis in 172 patients, is being led by Ellen Mowry, an associate professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cI do discuss vitamin D with my patients,\u201d Mowry says. \u201cBut I point out that we don\u2019t yet have randomized, controlled-trials data to back it up. That\u2019s why there are no official recommendations yet from any medical organizations. We have to be sure.\u201d\n\nSo what are people to do in the meantime? Four years ago, Manson sat on a committee established by the Institute of Medicine to review how much vitamin D and calcium Americans need each day to maintain health and prevent disease. The report concluded that both are necessary for bone health but that as for preventing cancer, heart disease, diabetes and autoiummune disorders, the evidence was \u201cinconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements.\u201d Even so, the committee recommended that children and adults up to age 70 get 600 IU of vitamin D daily \u2014 from food and, if necessary, supplements \u2014 and that adults age 71 and older get 800 IU.\n\nSome studies have found no ill effects from taking far higher amounts, and many of the prospective but not proven benefits against cancer and other diseases are believed to require doses ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 IU. Manson urges people to rely on the Institute of Medicine report, which set a safe upper limit of 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine to take that amount,\u201d Manson said. \u201cBut keep in mind, there isn\u2019t yet evidence that taking those higher amounts will confer any benefits beyond the recommended daily allotment of 600 to 800 IU.\u201d\n\nSome studies, she noted, have even found evidence that very high levels of vitamin D circulating in the blood might be just as unhealthful as very low levels. A 2014 study, for instance, found that people with the highest levels of vitamin D in their blood (more than 60 nanograms per milliliter) were significantly more likely to die in the three months following a hospitalization as were people whose levels were between 30 and 49.9 ng/mL. Such findings are why she, Mowry and Pittas strongly advise people against taking more than the currently recommended upper daily limit of 4,000 IU, even though doses as high as 10,000 IU are available online and at many stores.\n\nFrustrated by the uncertainty? Pittas takes it in stride.\n\n\u201cThis is the beauty of medical research,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere you have some people convinced that vitamin D does nothing and others who believe it\u2019s already proved to work. There is such controversy now that the only way to convince people who sit on those sides of the equation is to complete rigorous, randomized trials. We\u2019ll see what happens. I have a hypothesis that vitamin D will work, but we have to test it. At the end of the studies, one of us will be right. I just don\u2019t know which one.\u201d\n\nHurley is a science journalist and author of \u201cNatural Causes: Death, Lies and Politics in America\u2019s Vitamin and Herbal Supplement Industry\u201d (Broadway Books, 2007).", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/14/Health-Environment-Science/Images/bigstock_Vitamin_D_Softgels_6616031_12_0_835920688.jpg?t=20170517", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/10/Health-Environment-Science/Images/iStock_000010839613_Double.jpg?uuid=VJV1blf4EeWLsbSI0jG7og", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/14/Health-Environment-Science/Images/bigstock_Vitamin_D_Softgels_6616031_12_0_835920688.jpg?uuid=MHeV1lsOEeWOntzooqKmeQ", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/14/Health-Environment-Science/Images/bigstock_Vitamin_D_Softgels_6616031_12_0_835920688.jpg?t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Hurley", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/vitamin-d-supplements-panacea-placebo-or-something-in-between/2015/09/14/662699d2-469d-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html", "title": "Vitamin D supplements: Panacea, placebo or something in between?", "meta_data": {"eomportal-uuid": "662699d2-469d-11e5-846d-02792f854297", "object-hash": 1573334206, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "keywords": "health", "news_keywords": "health", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Washington Post", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/vitamin-d-supplements-panacea-placebo-or-something-in-between/2015/09/14/662699d2-469d-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/09/14/Health-Environment-Science/Images/bigstock_Vitamin_D_Softgels_6616031_12_0_835920688.jpg?t=20170517", "title": "Vitamin D supplements: Panacea, placebo or something in between?", "description": "Researchers hope three big trials will end debate about the health benefits of the \u2018sunshine vitamin.\u2019"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762, "admins": 500835072}, "description": "Researchers hope three big trials will end debate about the health benefits of the \u2018sunshine vitamin.\u2019", "robots": "index,follow", "theme": "normal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1442203200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
