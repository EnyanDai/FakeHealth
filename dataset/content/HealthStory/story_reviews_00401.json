ALPMY -0.78% of Japan, and Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe two blockbuster drugs have significantly extended survival for many patients with advanced prostate cancer. But in a study published last month, patients who tested positive for the anomaly\u2014a variant of the androgen receptor called AR-V7\u2014lived substantially longer if they were treated with chemotherapy than those given the two new drugs. The receptor is the target of the new drugs.\n\n\u201cIf AR-V7 was present, the patients didn\u2019t respond to the [new] agents,\u201d said Howard Scher, chief of genitourinary oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. \u201cThey progressed more quickly and they didn\u2019t live as long\u201d as those treated with chemo. Dr. Scher is lead author of the study, which was published online by the journal JAMA Oncology.\n\nThe findings suggest that patients with the variant can improve their survival chances while avoiding use of the more-costly therapies. Xtandi\u2019s price is $9,370 a month while Zytiga\u2019s is about $8,600. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel, the standard so-called taxane chemotherapies for advanced prostate cancer, cost several hundred dollars a month, researchers said.\n\n\u201cYou get both improved clinical outcome and economic benefits to the health system,\u201d said Murali Prahalad, Epic\u2019s president and chief executive.\n\nThe retrospective study involved 161 men. Researchers said the test needs further validation in larger, prospective randomized trials. The companies believe the recent study, and previous research linking a poor response to the two drugs to the AR-V7 variant, are sufficient validation for clinical use, said Phil Febbo, Genomic Health\u2019s chief medical officer. They plan to launch the test early next year while more rigorous studies are under way. The price hasn\u2019t been determined.\n\nThe companies estimate that about 50,000 U.S. patients a year have advanced prostate cancer that has progressed after standard hormone therapy and would be candidates for the test as they and their doctors consider treatment with the new agents. Studies suggest as many as 20% may have the AR-V7 variant, or acquire it as their tumors change during courses of therapy.\n\nThe agreement bolsters Genomic Health\u2019s portfolio of cancer diagnostic tests intended to help doctors tailor treatment based on the molecular traits of their patients\u2019 tumors. Its OncotypeDX line of tests for breast, prostate and colon cancers gives patients with early-stage disease information on whether they\u2019re likely to benefit from chemotherapy\u2014or in the case of the prostate, other aggressive care\u2014as part of their treatment. The new pact is part of Genomic Health\u2019s plan to provide diagnostics to guide treatment for metastatic, or advanced disease.\n\nThe test is called a liquid biopsy because it analyzes blood instead of tumor tissue to determine if the mutation is present. It is based on technology that cannot only detect AR-V7 but also determine whether it is in the nucleus of individual tumor cells.\n\nThe presence of the AR-V7 in the nucleus is a key factor in whether patients respond to the new drugs, Dr. Scher said. In the study, no patient determined to have the variant in a single tumor cell\u2019s nucleus responded to either Xtandi or Zytiga.\n\nIn the study, a positive test for AR-V7 didn\u2019t assure patients would respond to the chemotherapy, nor did a negative test promise a response to the Xtandi or Zytiga.\n\nUnder the agreement, which covers commercializing the test in the U.S., Genomic Health is making an equity investment in Epic. Specific financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed.\n\nQiagen NV of Germany and Tokai Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, are codeveloping an AR-V7 liquid biopsy test based on different technology as a diagnostic test for Tokai\u2019s experimental prostate-cancer drug called galeterone intended to treat men who test positive for AR-V7.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nThe wholesale acquisition cost of the prostate cancer drug Xtandi, marketed by Astellas Pharma Inc. of Japan and Medivation Inc., is about $9,400 a month compared to about $8,600 for rival drug Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson. An earlier version of this article quoted Xtandi\u2019s price as more than $10,000, using the average wholesale price, which is higher than the wholesale acquisition cost.
