Next, patients can try costlier alternatives such as botox injections, a device called miraDry that delivers electromagnetic energy to decompose sweat glands, or laser therapy to destroy them.\n\nSufferers can also opt for localized surgery, like liposuction, to remove or injure sweat glands. Oral medicines can be used to systemically limit sweating. For instance, a class of drugs called anticholinergics are commonly used off-label for this purpose, but they are linked with the risk of dementia.\n\nBased on the most recent estimates, about 7.8 million Americans have some form of excessive sweating including palms, feet, underarms or head, and about half of this population suffer from the underarm form, said Dermira spokeswoman Erica Jefferson, in an interview ahead of the data readout.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company\u2019s shares were up 3 percent at $33.00 in extended trading on Wednesday.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the total 697 enrolled in the two trials for the company\u2019s topical treatment, DRM04, were treated with wipes containing DRM04, while the rest were not.\n\nIn the first trial, a significant improvement in the severity of sweating was seen in 52.8 percent of the patients treated with the drug, compared with 28.3 percent patients in the control group, on a scale designed by the company.\n\nIn the second trial, a significant improvement was seen in 66.1 percent of the drug-treated patients, compared with 26.9 percent in the control group.\n\nDermira said it had expected to apply for marketing approval for the drug in the second half of 2017, subject to completion of the drug\u2019s long-term safety trial.", "images":
