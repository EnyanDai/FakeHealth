More than six million children in the United States have asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as do more than 330 million children and adults worldwide, according to the Global Asthma Network.\n\nDr. Bisgaard said it was not possible to tell from the study whether pregnant women could benefit from simply eating more fish. Pregnant women are generally advised to limit their consumption of certain types of fish like swordfish and tuna because they contain mercury. But many other types are considered safe, especially smaller fish like sardines that are not at the top of the food chain and therefore not likely to accumulate mercury and other contaminants from eating other fish.\n\nThe results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists bought fish oil from a company that makes it, but they said the company had no role in the study. The research was paid for by the Danish government and private foundations.\n\nAn editorial in the same journal by an expert who was not part of the study praised the research, saying it was well designed and carefully performed. The author of that editorial, Dr. Christopher E. Ramsden, from the National Institutes of Health, said the findings would help doctors develop a \u201cprecision medicine\u201d approach in which fish-oil treatment could be tailored to women who are most likely to benefit.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/29/science/29FISHOIL/29FISHOIL-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/29/science/29FISHOIL/29FISHOIL-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/29/science/29FISHOIL/29FISHOIL-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Grady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/health/fish-oil-asthma-pregnancy.html", "title": "Taking Fish Oil During Pregnancy Is Found to Lower Child\u2019s Asthma Risk", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2016-12-28T22:00:14.000Z", "modified": "2016-12-28T22:00:59.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-grady", "tag": "Denmark", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004842879, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/14402862-05eb-587d-b8b2-b72128ba88fe", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/78902b236ba6401c9ba6a91dbcfeddf2", "description": "Babies of women who took fish oil in the last three months of pregnancy had a 31 percent lower risk of developing asthma by age 3, a study in Denmark found.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/29/science/29FISHOIL/29FISHOIL-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Denise Grady", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/29/science/29FISHOIL/29FISHOIL-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": ",Asthma,Pregnancy,Oils and Fats,The New England Journal of Medicine,University of Copenhagen,Copenhagen,Denmark", "pdate": 20161228, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/health/fish-oil-asthma-pregnancy.html", "type": "article", "title": "Taking Fish Oil During Pregnancy Is Found to Lower Child\u2019s Asthma Risk", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/29/science/29FISHOIL/29FISHOIL-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "The doses of fish oil used in a Danish study were high, 2.4 grams per day \u2014 15 to 20 times what most Americans consume from foods."}, "description": "Babies of women who took fish oil in the last three months of pregnancy had a 31 percent lower risk of developing asthma by age 3, a study in Denmark found."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/health/fish-oil-asthma-pregnancy.html", "title": "Taking Fish Oil During Pregnancy Is Found to Lower Child\u2019s Asthma Risk", "description": "Babies of women who took fish oil in the last three months of pregnancy had a 31 percent lower risk of developing asthma by age 3, a study in Denmark found.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/29/science/29FISHOIL/29FISHOIL-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "The doses of fish oil used in a Danish study were high, 2.4 grams per day \u2014 15 to 20 times what most Americans consume from foods."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004842879"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/health/fish-oil-asthma-pregnancy.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004842879", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/health/fish-oil-asthma-pregnancy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/health/fish-oil-asthma-pregnancy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1482901200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
