Watson erupts in tears as she calls her mother to say this is the first time she's been able to write her name in ages.\n\nWhen the lights went up, Nadella welcomed both Lawton and engineer Zhang on stage, thanking them for showing that thanks \"developers can have impact.\"\n\nEmma Watch remains a prototype, Microsoft says, but the developers are working with a neuroscience research team to undertake trials with a small group of Parkinson's sufferers.\n\nThe watch works through a combination of sensors and AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to potentially detect and monitor symptoms like tremors, stiffness and instability, among others, according to Microsoft. \"Once these symptoms can be identified and measured, it\u2019s possible to develop technology and devices that help humans manage their symptoms. AI is used to classify the sensor information and elicit real-time responses on small devices like wearables.\"\n\nMicrosoft stresses that Emma Watch is not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 10 million people. \"Rather, its technology has the potential to help Parkinson\u2019s patients manage symptoms that impede regular functions. The goal of further research is to determine whether Emma Watch could help other people with similar Parkinson\u2019s symptoms.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter.", "images": ["https://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201705/3342/29906170001_5426415509001_5426417204001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ccd6f3e7f7f3e0d6c2ea0b3fb8b38a413240c29/c=0-1-810-459/local/-/media/2017/05/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636300255563059023-Emma-Watch.jpeg?width=810&height=458&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ccd6f3e7f7f3e0d6c2ea0b3fb8b38a413240c29/c=0-1-810-459/local/-/media/2017/05/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636300255563059023-Emma-Watch.jpeg?width=810&height=458&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/05/10/microsoft-shows-off-watch-quiets-parkinsons-tremors/101517718/", "title": "Microsoft shows off watch that quiets Parkinson's tremors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Microsoft shows off watch that quiets Parkinson's tremors", "description": "The tech company showed off a prototype that vibrates to disrupt the feedback loop that results in shaking.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2017/05/10/microsoft-shows-off-watch-quiets-parkinsons-tremors/101517718/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ccd6f3e7f7f3e0d6c2ea0b3fb8b38a413240c29/c=0-1-810-459/local/-/media/2017/05/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636300255563059023-Emma-Watch.jpeg?width=810&height=458&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 810, "height": 458}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Marco della Cava", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The tech company showed off a prototype that vibrates to disrupt the feedback loop that results in shaking.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9ccd6f3e7f7f3e0d6c2ea0b3fb8b38a413240c29/c=0-1-810-459/local/-/media/2017/05/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636300255563059023-Emma-Watch.jpeg?width=810&height=405&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Microsoft shows off watch that quiets Parkinson's tremors", "description": "The tech company showed off a prototype that vibrates to disrupt the feedback loop that results in shaking."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494388800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
