Yet there are only 45,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer a year compared with more than 230,000 new breast cancer cases.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/pancreatic-cancer-drug-found-to-extend-life.html", "title": "Drug Is Shown to Help Pancreatic Cancer Cases", "meta_data": {"alternateTitle": "A Drug Shows Promise In Treating Pancreatic Cancer", "article": {"published": "2013-01-22T23:37:59.000Z", "modified": "2013-01-23T00:47:31.000Z", "section": "Business", "tag": "Celgene Corporation", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000002020214, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/41ee7762-4e7c-5a2b-872f-252e6b21c1aa", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/f33af48258db45ac8cb365cd6effc422", "description": "Celgene\u2019s drug Abraxane prolonged the lives of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer by almost two months in a clinical trial, but the gains were not as big as expected.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "byl": "By Andrew Pollack", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": ",Pancreatic cancer,Clinical trial,Pharmaceuticals,,Celgene", "pdate": 20130122, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/pancreatic-cancer-drug-found-to-extend-life.html", "type": "article", "title": "Drug Is Shown to Help Pancreatic Cancer Cases", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "description": "Celgene\u2019s drug Abraxane prolonged the lives of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer by almost two months in a clinical trial, but the gains were not as big as expected."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/pancreatic-cancer-drug-found-to-extend-life.html", "title": "Drug Is Shown to Help Pancreatic Cancer Cases", "description": "Celgene\u2019s drug Abraxane prolonged the lives of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer by almost two months in a clinical trial, but the gains were not as big as expected.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002020214"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "business", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/pancreatic-cancer-drug-found-to-extend-life.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002020214", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/pancreatic-cancer-drug-found-to-extend-life.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/pancreatic-cancer-drug-found-to-extend-life.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1358917200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
