Just under a third of women taking flibanserin got over their sexual distress and/or lack of sexual desire (vs. about a fifth of women taking placebo pills). But the difference was important to the women, says study researcher Michael L. Krychman, MD, medical director of sexual medicine at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif.\n\n\"The absolute number of women who had remission of sexual distress was clinically significant, but equally important to them was how it improved their lives,\" Krychman tells WebMD.\n\nNearly half of women taking flibanserin (and nearly a third of women taking placebo) reported at least minimal improvement in \"bothersome decreased sexual desire.\"\n\nFlibanserin is taken nightly at bedtime. However, it's not an on-demand treatment. Data suggest that the drug begins to affect sexual satisfaction after four weeks of continuous treatment.\n\nIn the 24-week \"Bouquet\" studies (each of the Boehringer Ingelheim-funded studies is named after a flower), there were few drug-related side effects. Those most commonly reported were daytime sleepiness, dizziness, fatigue, anxiety, dry mouth, nausea, and insomnia. Some 15% of women on flibanserin, and 7% of those on placebo, stopped treatment due to side effects.\n\nUpdated reports on data from the North American \"Daisy\" and \"Violet\" studies were made by Krychman and other researchers at this week's annual meeting of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in San Francisco.\n\nKychman is an advisor to Boehringer Ingelheim and serves on their speakers' bureau, services for which he is compensated.", "images":
