Now, there is a new solution for people with a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 that want to lose weight called the Orbera gastric balloon.\n\nDr. Prem Chattoo, a New York based gastroenterologist, told FoxNews.com that the balloon is placed it into the stomach through the mouth. It is then inflated with saline during the procedure that lasts about 45 minutes. Patients are treated in office and are kept under mild to moderate sedation. The balloon remains in the patient\u2019s stomach for six months and is then removed the same way it was inserted, through the mouth.\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the procedure is that it is a nonsurgical procedure,\u201d Chattoo said. In addition to eliminating the scarring and risks involved with more invasive options, Chattoo said that the recovery time is also much faster.\n\nThe objective of the Orbera system is the make the patient feel partially satiated so they eat smaller, but more nutritious portions. Chattoo also offers patients a nutritionist and trainer with the procedure. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry.\n\nMarie Brown chose to undergo the procedure and credits Orbera for helping her lose over 20 pounds in three and a half months. She told FoxNews.com that the balloon \u201cmakes you feel full all the time to the point where you\u2019re not angry about having to lose things like chocolate and cake.\u201d\n\nBrown said that the balloon acted like a \u201crestart button\u201d and retrained her body to adapt to a new lifestyle of healthy eating and exercise.\n\nOrbera is not for the morbidly obese or those who have had surgical procedures affecting the stomach or intestinal lining. It is meant for people looking for an extra jumpstart on a diet, whether the purpose is cosmetic or for health reasons.\n\n\u201cWe might be able to prevent young, healthy people from having these chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension,\u201d Chattoo said.\n\nThe most common side effect of installing the balloon is nausea that lasts a few days. Chattoo said that even if the balloon were to pop, the saline would be absorbed and pose no harm to the patient. The balloon would be removed in the same way it is at the six month mark.\n\nOrbera is not covered by insurance and costs $8,000.
