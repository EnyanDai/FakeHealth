The probe not only allows the doctor to see the fibroid using ultrasound, but it also has a radio-frequency device at the tip. The doctor hits a foot pedal to send energy through the probe to heat the fibroid, shrinking it over time. The body absorbs the dead tissue, so it does not have to be surgically removed.", "images": ["https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/fKm4SllKk6mkn6M0rH7ozwenANs=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/mDwk_FQ4BfatGCa7MQxWRPj4cOE=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/ybgUB4ajc6gPEc-69dpwdJbepDk=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5O2O6G5KFA7LEYE3XSGCR5PKQ.jpg", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/F-N8i3PLND7jI2semtOn2AwLUlE=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/QhsSiv5Pp6R9UYYdEXuIxRWg5vk=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/P0EHv7XwRp9Ip-NEdUO9xOVtfow=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13"], "top_img": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/mDwk_FQ4BfatGCa7MQxWRPj4cOE=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/ybgUB4ajc6gPEc-69dpwdJbepDk=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P5O2O6G5KFA7LEYE3XSGCR5PKQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lini S.
