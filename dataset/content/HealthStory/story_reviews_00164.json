But the disease made a comeback in the 1990s, as the newer \"acellular\" vaccine \u2014 containing only cellular material but not whole cells \u2014 was phased in. While it is safer and has fewer side effects than the old version, studies have found that its protective effects wane more quickly than originally expected.", "images": ["https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/fKm4SllKk6mkn6M0rH7ozwenANs=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/rYb444OGH3KR1YxWQDqxnT3B0LU=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/CACRqOktln8zNAQ2n_qV8xl4EWI=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DFKHHAUQQFHP7OR6D5Q2GDAZVY.jpg", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/tfZA9kRAGr1RDHxAMH9uzhXU5n8=/120x120/center/middle/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/pmn/d1e53e6b-4280-4395-8310-3032813bd013.png", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/QhsSiv5Pp6R9UYYdEXuIxRWg5vk=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/F-N8i3PLND7jI2semtOn2AwLUlE=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/gjVIlYYdEuKAAnNw8XWXw3PxnRg=/1400x932/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DFKHHAUQQFHP7OR6D5Q2GDAZVY.jpg", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/P0EHv7XwRp9Ip-NEdUO9xOVtfow=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13"], "top_img": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/rYb444OGH3KR1YxWQDqxnT3B0LU=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/CACRqOktln8zNAQ2n_qV8xl4EWI=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DFKHHAUQQFHP7OR6D5Q2GDAZVY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marie Mccullough", "Anndee Hochman", "For The Inquirer", "Anthony R.
