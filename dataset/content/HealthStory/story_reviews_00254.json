{"url": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/10/facial-recognition-genetic-disorders/", "text": "Dr. Maximilian Muenke has a superpower: He can diagnose disease just by looking at a person\u2019s face.\n\nSpecifically, he can spot certain genetic disorders that make telltale impressions on facial features.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve done it for a certain amount of years, you walk into a room and it\u2019s like, oh, that child has Williams syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to a genetic disorder that can affect a person\u2019s cognitive abilities and heart.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s an incredibly useful skill, even as genetic sequencing becomes more widespread. For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don\u2019t have access to genetic tests at all.\n\nThat\u2019s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient\u2019s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.\n\nSome older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners \u2014 a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.\n\nMeanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.\n\nIt\u2019s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics\u2019 systemic blind spots.\n\nDiagnoses vs. probabilities\n\nThe algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They\u2019re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.\n\nBut they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall \u201clook\u201d of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won\u2019t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, \u201cDoes my patient have a genetic disorder?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases \u2014 a means to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,\u201d said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.\n\nDrawing that bright line between Face2Gene and \u201ca diagnostic tool\u201d allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.\n\nDiversity needed\n\nThe algorithm the NIH uses \u2014 developed by scientists at Children\u2019s National Health System in Washington, D.C., \u2014 seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.\n\nFace2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. \u201cSince Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,\u201d Gelbman cautioned.\n\nBut there\u2019s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cIn every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,\u201d Muenke said. \u201cWhen I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren\u2019t. There just aren\u2019t.\u201d (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH\u2019s work.)\n\nSo diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn\u2019t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. \u201cWe have thought about it but haven\u2019t gone there yet,\u201d Muenke said.\n\nFor example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges \u2014 as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome \u2014 the angles between landmark points on the child\u2019s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children\u2019s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other \u201ctypical\u201d features weren\u2019t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.\n\nIn fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. \u201cOne of the findings that I\u2019m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,\u201d Linguraru said.\n\nTo continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients\u2019 faces \u2014 but that\u2019s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH\u2019s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.\n\nThose numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. \u201cMost practitioners are located in North America and Europe,\u201d Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn\u2019t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH\u2019s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 \u201cskinny\u201d budget proposal announced in March.)\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine.

FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm\u2019s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.\n\nAs both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.", "images": ["https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsletter-Logo-Images-DR.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/stat-logo.svg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/plugins/stat-lazy-load/images/330x400-00000000.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/face-scan-1024x576.jpeg", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=46858&fmt=gif", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Circular_Kate.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=436331036555416&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/face-scan-1024x576.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Sheridan", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Sharon Begley", "Megan Thielking", "Elizabeth Preston", "Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/10/facial-recognition-genetic-disorders/", "title": "Facial-recognition software finds new use: diagnosing genetic disorders", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "origin", "description": "Software that analyzes a patient's face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Facial-recognition software finds new use: diagnosing genetic disorders", "description": "Software that analyzes a patient's face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/10/facial-recognition-genetic-disorders/", "site_name": "STAT", "updated_time": "2017-04-10T17:18:25+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/face-scan-1024x576.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/face-scan-1024x576.jpeg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "tag": "research", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2017-04-10T08:30:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-10T17:18:25+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Software that analyzes a patient's face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.", "title": "Facial-recognition software finds new use: diagnosing genetic disorders", "site": "@statnews", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/face-scan-1024x576.jpeg", "creator": "@sheridan_kate"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/10/facial-recognition-genetic-disorders/?ia_markup=1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1324796990", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-328x328.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491796800.0, "source": "https://www.statnews.com", "summary": ""}
