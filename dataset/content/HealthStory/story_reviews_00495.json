The task force said it concluded \u201cwith moderate certainty\u201d that the benefit was moderate in women 50 to 74 and small in women 40 to 49.\n\nFor every 10,000 women screened repeatedly over 10 years, four lives are saved in women 40 to 49; eight in women 50 to 59; 21 in women 60 to 69; and 13 in women 70 to 74, the task force found.\n\n\u201cThe science supports mammography as an important tool in the fight against breast cancer,\u201d said Dr. Michael LeFevre, a former chairman of the task force and a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri. He noted that breast cancer deaths have decreased since mammography came into widespread use in the 1980s, though some of the decline, he said, was also due to better treatments. \u201cWe believe the benefits increase with age. But there are harms, and particularly in their 40s, women have to make a decision for themselves.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/12/science/12MAMMOGRAM/12MAMMOGRAM-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/12/science/12MAMMOGRAM/12MAMMOGRAM-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/12/science/12MAMMOGRAM/12MAMMOGRAM-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Grady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/health/mammogram-breast-cancer-screen-advice-guidance.html", "title": "Panel Reasserts Mammogram Advice That Triggered Breast Cancer Debate", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2016-01-11T22:26:08.000Z", "modified": "2016-01-12T21:22:44.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-grady", "tag": "Annals of Internal Medicine", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004138195, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/19068049-eccb-5236-a7f9-95414ffd9332", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/6c2bcc2c481940e2a2ee0a09c22011af", "description": "A medical panel issued an update to its guidelines Monday, but still says women with average risk of breast cancer can safely begin screening at 50.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/12/science/12MAMMOGRAM/12MAMMOGRAM-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Denise Grady", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/12/science/12MAMMOGRAM/12MAMMOGRAM-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Mammography,,Breast cancer,Preventive medicine,United States Preventive Services Task Force,Annals of Internal Medicine", "pdate": 20160111, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/health/mammogram-breast-cancer-screen-advice-guidance.html", "type": "article", "title": "Panel Reasserts Mammogram Advice That Triggered Breast Cancer Debate", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/12/science/12MAMMOGRAM/12MAMMOGRAM-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "Dr. Michael LeFevre, a former chairman of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, said younger women have to make decisions for themselves about mammography."}, "description": "A medical panel issued an update to its guidelines Monday, but still says women with average risk of breast cancer can safely begin screening at 50."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/health/mammogram-breast-cancer-screen-advice-guidance.html", "title": "Panel Reasserts Mammogram Advice That Triggered Breast Cancer Debate", "description": "A medical panel issued an update to its guidelines Monday, but still says women with average risk of breast cancer can safely begin screening at 50.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/12/science/12MAMMOGRAM/12MAMMOGRAM-articleLarge.jpg", "alt": "Dr. Michael LeFevre, a former chairman of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, said younger women have to make decisions for themselves about mammography."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004138195"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/health/mammogram-breast-cancer-screen-advice-guidance.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004138195", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/health/mammogram-breast-cancer-screen-advice-guidance.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/health/mammogram-breast-cancer-screen-advice-guidance.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1452574800.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
