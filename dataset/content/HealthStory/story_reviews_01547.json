The 539 men completing the two studies, who were randomly assigned to the real drug or the fake version, had an average time of less than 36 seconds before they took part in the research. That meant the drug was linked to a 5.5-fold increase in time before ejaculation, compared to a 1.6-fold gain for the placebo.\n\nThe increase is \"clinically significant,\" says Tom Lue, a professor of urology at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn't involved in the research. \"People will be much happier.\"\n\nThe primary findings of both trials had previously been made public, but researchers combined them and added new data in abstracts set to be presented Tuesday at the American Urological Association's annual meeting in San Francisco. The studies lasted three months, but researchers allowed participants to choose to continue with the drug. Its effectiveness apparently didn't diminish over a span as long as nine additional months.\n\nMen who used the spray rated their sexual experiences significantly higher on measures of control and satisfaction, and reported less distress than those who got placebo, according to the researchers.\n\nThe spray, currently referred to as PSD502, hasn't won regulatory approval to be marketed. The company that owns rights to the product, Japan's Shionogi & Co. Ltd., says it hopes to apply to the Food and Drug Administration and is already in discussions with the agency.\n\nDoctors are not sure what causes men to have the problem, which may involve an abnormality of the central nervous system or extreme nerve sensitivity in the penis that leads ejaculation to be triggered. Psychological factors may also play a role.\n\nTreatment for premature ejaculation has long been seen as a potentially lucrative opportunity for drug makers, which found major success with drugs for erectile dysfunction, a condition that was also once considered taboo for public discussion. Surveys have suggested that as many as 20% to 30% of men may suffer from premature ejaculation, though these figures are often drawn from broadly worded survey questions and may overstate the number of men with significant problems.\n\nThe field suffered a setback in 2005, when the FDA rejected an application from Johnson & Johnson to market a drug called Priligy; the agency doesn't typically reveal its reasons for such decisions publicly. To date no treatment has won the FDA's nod for use in premature ejaculation. The J&J drug, which works similarly to antidepressants such as Prozac, has been approved for use in 12 countries, including Germany and South Korea. A company spokeswoman says Johnson & Johnson is \"evaluating its path forward in the U.S.\" for Priligy.\n\nIn the U.S., men can try certain antidepressants or numbing creams, which aren't FDA-approved for premature ejaculation, or work with a sex therapist or psychologist. These are \"less-than-perfect alternatives,\" says Anthony Smith, a urologist at the University of New Mexico who was not involved in the research on PSD502.\n\nThe spray may work by damping excessive sensitivity, says Ira Sharlip, a clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco who was involved in the PSD502 research. It is sprayed on the tip of the penis five minutes before sex. In the studies, men and their partners were given stopwatches to time the length of their intercourse.\n\nDr. Sharlip says the spray doesn't generally lead to numbness, a problem men might fear from a product involving lidocaine, which many associate with killing the pain of dental procedures. Prilocaine is also sometimes used as a numbing agent in dentistry. About 6.9% of the men reported side effects, with the most common being loss of erection, seen in 3%, or at least some loss of sensation, in 1.7%. Also, 0.6% of the men's female partners reported at least some loss of sensation. In all cases, the issues were temporary, the researchers said.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "images":
