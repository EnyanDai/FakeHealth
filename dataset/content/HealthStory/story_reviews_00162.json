No relationship was observed between exercise and later anxiety, but the researchers did find a link between exercise and later depression.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed.\n\nThe study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one\u2014especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index.\n\nIf their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week.\n\nThat exercise doesn\u2019t have to be intense, either, they say. People seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat.\n\nMORE: 7 Surprising Benefits of Exercise\n\n\u201cGiven that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,\u201d the authors wrote in their paper, \u201cit may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.\u201d\n\nOf course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. Both the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health.\n\nBut when it comes to mental health benefits, \u201cthe majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week,\u201d said study author Samuel Harvey, associate professor of workplace mental health at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales, in an email.\n\nMORE: A New Hope For Depression\n\nThe authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression. It\u2019s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins.\n\n\u201cThere is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,\u201d says Harvey. \u201cOur study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-14.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/running-helps-you-live-longer.jpg?quality=85&w=400", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/gettyimages-548554295.jpeg?quality=85&w=600"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-14.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Macmillan"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4966319/exercise-depression-study/", "title": "Just One Hour of Exercise a Week May Help Prevent Depression", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "exercise, depression, anxiety, mood, does exercise help anxiety, does exercise help depression, physical activity, mental health, endorphins, brain health", "news_keywords": "exercise, depression, anxiety, mood, does exercise help anxiety, does exercise help depression, physical activity, mental health, endorphins, brain health", "description": "Regular exercise may prevent many cases of future depression, and researchers say that as little as one hour a week can make a difference.", "og": {"title": "Just One Hour of Exercise a Week May Help Prevent Depression", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4966319/exercise-depression-study/", "description": "For mental-health benefits, more isn't always better.", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-14.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4966319/exercise-depression-study/", "description": "Regular exercise may prevent many cases of future depression, and researchers say that as little as one hour a week can make a difference.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-14.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4966319/exercise-depression-study/", "title": "Just One Hour of Exercise a Week May Help Prevent Depression", "description": "For mental-health benefits, more isn't always better.", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/time-magazine-exercise-fitness-health-bethan-mooney-14.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
