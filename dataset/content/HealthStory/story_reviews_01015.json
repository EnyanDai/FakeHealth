Even so, the results were dramatic.\n\nTotal cholesterol dropped from 256 to 230, while the LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol decreased from 173 to 148, according to the study.\n\nJenkins said participants achieved these results even though compliance to the whole grain, vegetarian diet was only about 40%.\n\nIn addition to the soy protein, nuts and whole grains, participants in the diet were encouraged to eat peas, beans and lentils.\n\nA control group advised to eat a vegetarian, low-saturated diet but not with the cholesterol-lowering foods a saw a slight dip in total cholesterol, from 249 to 246, and in LDL, from 167 to 161.\n\nBoth groups lost about four pounds over the six months.\n\nThe 351 participants in the study suffered from high cholesterol but were not on a cholesterol-lowering statin medication. The study was conducted from June 2007 to February 2009 at academic centers in Quebec City, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver.\n\nFollow CNNHealth on Twitter", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/06/24/tzsrch.couple.gi.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/03/26/tzsrch.triathlon.cnn.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/03/26/tzsrch.iv.ts.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/belief.blog/rss.14x14.gif", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/03/26/tzsrch.healthy.eating.ts.jpg", "http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png?m=1354137473h", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5d361982e37b059f008e403613bc1695?s=48&d=identicon&r=G", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/11/26/tzsrch.boy.chest.doctor.ts.jpg", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a73066adc48465b007706772b2119b22?s=48&d=identicon&r=G", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/06/30/tzsrch.sanjay.bridge.cnn.jpg", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/722838cea03ccb98c071fc9502989fad?s=48&d=identicon&r=G", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/right_rail/grey_corner_TL.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/1px.gif", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/6cda7948cf6c64002a7e65c8fd36fac8?s=48&d=identicon&r=G", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/03/26/tzsrch.psychology.ts.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/23/t1larg.highfibervegetarian.ts.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/06/24/tzsrch.brain.gi.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/11/26/tzsrch.sleep.ts.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22cf6b168f082ec214ee0d94431f5b3e?s=48&d=identicon&r=G", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/images/1.gif", "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/right_rail/grey_corner_BL.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/icons/btn_close.gif", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/11/26/tzsrch.experts.cnn.jpg"], "top_img": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/23/t1larg.highfibervegetarian.ts.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/23/real-world-results-for-cholesterol-lowering-diet/", "title": "Bran, soy help cut cholesterol", "meta_data": {"title": "Bran, soy help cut cholesterol", "description": "Editor's note:\u00a0Tune in as Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the signs, tests and lifestyle changes that could make cardiac problems a thing of the past on \"The Last Heart Attack,\" Saturday, August 27, 8 and 11 p.m. ET on CNN.", "keywords": "cholesterol, healthy eating, heart, nutrition, david martin - cnn medical senior producer", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "The Chart", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s1.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "og": {"title": "Bran, soy help cut cholesterol", "url": "http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/23/real-world-results-for-cholesterol-lowering-diet/", "type": "article", "description": "Editor's note:\u00a0Tune in as Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the signs, tests and lifestyle changes that could make cardiac problems a thing of the past on \"The Last Heart Attack,\" Saturday, August 27, 8 and 11 p.m. ET on CNN.", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/23/t1larg.highfibervegetarian.ts.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1314072000.0, "source": "http://thechart.blogs.CNN.com", "summary": ""}
