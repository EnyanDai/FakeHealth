But side effects, including dizziness and daytime sleepiness, were commonly reported by users.\n\nMichael Sweeney, MD, who is vice president of research and development for Serada manufacturer Depomed Inc., says the company\u2019s slow-release gabapentin formulation avoids many of these side effects.\n\nAbout 60% of women who took the experimental drug in one study reported side effects, compared to about 50% of women taking placebo pills. About 8% and 18% of Serada users reported daytime sleepiness and dizziness, respectively, compared to about 3% and 8% of women who took a placebo.\n\n\u201cThese side effects, when they did occur, tended to occur early in treatment and disappear within a few weeks,\u201d Sweeney says.\n\nResearchers presented findings from two studies of Serada at the NAMS meeting.\n\nIn one study, the number of daily hot flashes experienced by postmenopausal women taking 1,800 milligrams of the drug per day declined from around 10 to around 2. But a similar reduction in hot flashes was seen in women who took placebo pills instead of the slow-release gabapentin.\n\nIn the second study, about 65% of women taking Serada reported significant improvement in hot flash symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment, compared to 45% of women taking placebo.\n\nNAMS founder and former executive director Wulf Utian, MD, says Serada does not appear to be as effective as hormonal therapy, but it may be a useful alternative treatment for women who can\u2019t take hormones or don\u2019t want to.\n\nUtian is now an independent consultant and was a co-author of one of the studies.\n\n\u201cEstrogen and estrogen-progestin drugs are about 95% effective for treating hot flashes,\u201d he tells WebMD. \u201cThis drug was about 60% to 65% effective, which is about the same efficacy that has been reported with antidepressants [for treatment of hot flashes].\u201d", "images":
