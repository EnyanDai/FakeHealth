special ADHD diet to see if eliminating certain foods might reduce their symptoms, Dutch researchers say.\n\nThe diet studied, known as the restricted elimination diet (RED), can work, the researchers say, because they believe ADHD symptoms in some children might be affected by eating specific foods.\n\n''I am of the opinion that every child deserves this diagnostic intervention,\" researcher Lidy Pelsser, PhD, of the ADHD Research Centre in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, tells WebMD.\n\nIn the study, published in The Lancet, 78% of children who stuck with the diet did respond by having fewer symptoms.\n\nIn five weeks of trying the diet, Pelsser says, parents will know if their child is responding or not; if not, they can move on to other treatments.\n\nU.S. experts had some caveats, saying that the results of the study, which included 100 children, should be repeated in other populations to see if the findings hold up.", "images":
