On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by T\u00fcv S\u00fcd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based.\n\nBut sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception.\n\nNatural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method.\n\n\n\nNatural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus.\n\n\"The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you've ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there's no egg to fertilise,\" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News.\n\n\n\nTaking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can't be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can't use it as a reliable form of birth control.\n\nYou don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning \u2013 although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you\u2019re taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators \u2013 temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions.\n\nBut natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs.\n\nAnd if you're considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won't like having to remember to take your temperature every morning.\n\n\"You really have to commit to it, whether you're doing it the traditional way or you're using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it's not really any use to you,\" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. \"It's not a method that's going to suit everybody.\"\n\nBut for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it's an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world.\n\n\"When it comes to contraception it's all about choice. It's not like one solution will fit all women,\" said Berglund.\n\n\"Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she's ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle.\"\n\n\n\nTo use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed.\n\n\n\nThe app then tells you if you're likely to be fertile or not that day. And if the app gives you a \"red day\" \u2013 meaning you could be fertile \u2013 you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.", "images": ["https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-02/8/13/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-06/sub-buzz-15077-1486578644-1.jpg?crop=392%3A569%3B0%2C127&downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-02/8/11/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-04/sub-buzz-19158-1486572745-1.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto&downsize=360:*", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-02/9/6/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/this-app-says-its-as-good-as-the-pill-at-preventi-2-17681-1486638820-4_dblbig.jpg", "https://pixiedust.buzzfeed.com/v1.gif?source=buzz_web&platform=bpager&type=instrumentation&target=javascript&value=disabled", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-02/17/11/user_images/webdr12/kellyoakes-v2-2719-1455726185-0_large.png?downsize=60:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=260954170738952&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-02/9/6/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/this-app-says-its-as-good-as-the-pill-at-preventi-2-17681-1486638820-4_dblbig.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Buzzfeed Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/kellyoakes/contraceptive-app", "title": "This App Says It's As Good As The Pill At Preventing Pregnancy, But Experts Want More Evidence", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright BuzzFeed, Inc.
