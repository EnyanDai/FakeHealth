The company is seeking FDA approval to market the drug to certain men to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The drug will be reviewed by an FDA advisory panel on Wednesday along with Merck & Co.'s Proscar, a drug similar to Avodart.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline conducted a study involving more than 8,000 men considered at high risk of developing prostate cancer. Overall, the study found a 23% reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer over a four-year period among those treated with Avodart, compared to patients receiving a placebo. The company has proposed that men considered at high risk for the development of prostate cancer are those who have had a prior negative biopsy and have an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen, or PSA.\n\nIn a document posted on the FDA's website Monday, the agency said the study results involving Avodart \"do not appear to confer clinical benefit for the indication under consideration.\"\n\nThe agency said the reduction in prostate cancer risk was driven by prostate cancers considered to be low-risk. There was an increase in prostate cancers considered \"high-risk\" or those with a so-called Gleason Score of 8 to 10 among patients treated with Avodart compared to those receiving a placebo drug, the FDA said. Higher Gleason Scores indicate more aggressive cancers.\n\nSpecifically, 29 high-grade tumors were found among patients being treated with Avodart compared to 19 in the placebo group.\n\nAnne Phillips, a medicines development leader at GlaxoSmithKline, said the company believes Avodart can be safely used to lower the risk of prostate cancer \"without interfering with the ability to pick up the high-grade cancer.\" She noted that men diagnosed with prostate cancer are often treated aggressively even in cases where their tumors are low-grade or low-risk.\n\nMerck is seeking to add the results of a separate clinical study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute that suggested Proscar cut the risk of prostate cancer, although the company isn't seeking FDA approval to market Proscar to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Proscar is widely available as a generic drug.\n\nThe FDA said the proposed label changes \"could be interpreted to suggest that Proscar is safe and effective for the prevention of prostate cancer in healthy men.\"\n\nThe agency said there was an increased risk of high-grade cancers among men treated with Proscar and a decreased risk of lower-grade cancers compared to those treated with a placebo over a period of about seven years.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com", "images":
