These infants often don\u2019t survive and, even if they do, many have substantial long-term health problems.\n\nThis new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides what is thought to be the best, large-scale data in the U.S. to date on this topic. The authors, from many institutions that form a large neonatal research network funded by the National Institutes of Health, studied nearly 5,000 babies born before 27 weeks at two-dozen high-quality hospitals across the country who were followed to 18-22 months of age.\n\nThose who were born at 22 weeks of gestation survived only 5% of the time. Of those who received active treatment to help them breathe or their hearts to beat, 23% lived, 15.4% survived without severe neurological impairment, such as cerebral palsy, and 9% survived without severe or moderate neurological impairment.\n\nIn comparison, the vast majority\u2014more than 80% -- of those born at week 26 survived with or without active care and nearly 60% had no severe or moderate neurological impairment.\n\n\u201cA large proportion of the variation [in outcome], especially at 22, 23 and 24 weeks, can be explained by differences in whether treatment was initiated,\u201d said Matthew Rysavy, the first author on the paper and a medical student at the University of Iowa.\n\nThe findings don\u2019t lead to a clear-cut conclusion about when and whether lifesaving care should be administered to the extremely premature, but provide more data to help inform doctors and families when they make their decision, said Mr. Rysavy.\n\nJust 22% of babies born at 22 weeks were given lifesaving treatments compared with 72% of babies born at week 23 and 97% of babies born at week 24. The type of care they received tended to depend on the hospital where they were born. However, it isn\u2019t clear from the data why the decision was made to provide a particular type of care, and what other factors played a role in the babies\u2019 outcomes besides whether they were given active treatments, said the authors.\n\nElizabeth Rogers, director of the Intensive Care Nursery Follow Up Program at the UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital San Francisco , who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, called the new study important because it highlights the large variation in outcomes for these very premature infants.\n\nThe paper \u201cshows that the question of when a premature infant can survive is so multifactorial and complex that no simple equation is going to be able to predict the outcome for any individual baby,\u201d said Dr. Rogers, a pediatrics professor.\n\nThe study suggests that with intervention, more babies may live. \u201cBut if meaningful, functional, fully participatory life is what they want, I think the study also shows this is not something we can promise them at these ages,\u201d said Dr. Rogers.\n\nThe University of California San Francisco has never resuscitated a baby born at 22 weeks because its own data suggest that at such an early gestational age, the \u201crisks of poor outcome have outweighed the possibility of a really good outcome for families,\u201d said Dr. Rogers, who said she wouldn\u2019t change her clinical practice based on the new study results.\n\nThursday\u2019s findings also highlight the importance for counseling parents, including about their child\u2019s longer-term prognosis, and the need for a standard approach of what and how to tell them, according to Dr. Rogers.\n\nPart of that conversation could be the survival rate not of all babies born at an early gestational age, but just those who received active treatment, said the University of Iowa\u2019s Mr. Rysavy.\n\nAt the University of Iowa\u2019s hospital, after having a conversation with parents of babies born at 22 weeks, the majority want their babies treated, said Edward Bell, another author on the paper and a pediatrics professor at the university.\n\n\u201cThese are very difficult decisions and they need to made on a case-by-case basis by the families and physicians,\u201d said Dr. Bell.\n\nCorrections & Amplifications:\n\nElizabeth Rogers\u2019s last name was misspelled as Rodgers in an earlier version of this article (5/8/15). Also, a statistical result from the study was incorrectly described in an earlier version of this article. The survival rate for all week 22 infants reflected those who received active treatment as well as those who didn\u2019t, not just those who didn\u2019t receive active treatment (5/12/15).\n\nWrite to Shirley S.
