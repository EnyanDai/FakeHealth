Trust me \u2013 you really don\u2019t want to know | Tim Lott Read more\n\nAbout half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people.\n\nCurrently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants, or combinations of them. That means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for 12 weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them.\n\nOne in six Britons will suffer depression at some point in their life. Last year 61.5m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England.\n\nResearchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood, as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants. They found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants. Their findings have been reported in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology.\n\n\u201cThe identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients,\u201d said Prof Carmine Pariante from KCL\u2019s institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience.\n\n\u201cThis study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy. Patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies, including the addition of other antidepressants or anti-inflammatory drugs,\u201d Pariante added.\n\nDr Cosmo Hallstrom, a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \u201cFinding biological markers for depression (and other mental illnesses) has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry.\n\n\u201cSuch a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression. It would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient.\u201d\n\nBut further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting, Hallstrom added.\n\nStephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind, said: \u201cWe welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems. These initial findings are interesting, but, as with all areas of mental health, there is still more research to be done.\u201d\n\nMental health problems, including depression, are estimated to cost \u00a3105bn a year in England. The World Health Organisation has predicted that by 2020 depression will be the second biggest cause of health problems in the world.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07606b89530f02c659422f824a7b8ff49d92fd4f/40_0_2310_1386/2310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=de2459f52f293c237e22e634362f02c5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07606b89530f02c659422f824a7b8ff49d92fd4f/40_0_2310_1386/master/2310.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c95d16420416eb6888854cc2b8cc873e", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Depression%2CDrugs%2CHealth%2CScience%2CMental+health%2CSociety%2CUK+news"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07606b89530f02c659422f824a7b8ff49d92fd4f/40_0_2310_1386/2310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=de2459f52f293c237e22e634362f02c5", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denis Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/07/blood-test-antidepressants-depression-treatement", "title": "Blood test could identify people who will respond to antidepressants", "meta_data": {"description": "Patients will potentially be able to avoid medications that do not help them and the test could start a \u2018new era\u2019 for personalised treatment of depression", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Denis Campbell", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07606b89530f02c659422f824a7b8ff49d92fd4f/40_0_2310_1386/2310.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9a81ff92c94ce714fddd8cc896dec74c", "keywords": "Depression,Drugs,Health,Science,Mental health,Society,UK news", "news_keywords": "Depression,Drugs,Health,Science,Mental health,Society,UK news", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/07/blood-test-antidepressants-depression-treatement", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07606b89530f02c659422f824a7b8ff49d92fd4f/40_0_2310_1386/2310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=de2459f52f293c237e22e634362f02c5", "description": "Patients will potentially be able to avoid medications that do not help them and the test could start a \u2018new era\u2019 for personalised treatment of depression", "type": "article", "title": "Blood test could identify people who will respond to antidepressants", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deniscampbell", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Society", "published_time": "2016-06-06T23:01:07.000Z", "tag": "Depression,Drugs,Health,Science,Mental health,Society,UK news", "modified_time": "2017-11-28T20:07:08.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2016/jun/07/blood-test-antidepressants-depression-treatement?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2016/jun/07/blood-test-antidepressants-depression-treatement?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/07/blood-test-antidepressants-depression-treatement", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2016/jun/07/blood-test-antidepressants-depression-treatement?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07606b89530f02c659422f824a7b8ff49d92fd4f/40_0_2310_1386/2310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&s=5ce4f4a2397954b793dc37bd92bc603a", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1465272000.0, "source": "http://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
