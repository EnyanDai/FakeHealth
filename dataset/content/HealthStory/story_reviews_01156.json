For decades, scientists had tried without success to maintain spermatogenesis (the multistage process by which spermatogonial stem cells grow to become sperm) in mammals in a lab setting.\n\nBut more important, wrote Dr. Marco Seandel and Dr. Shahin Rafii in a related Nature commentary, the breakthrough may one day help doctors design fertility treatments for men.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne group of patients to target? Young boys undergoing treatment for cancer.\n\nA possible side effect of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer is destruction of the cells that create sperm, rendering the patients infertile.\n\nAdults about to receive cancer treatment can bank sperm before their treatment, but that isn\u2019t an option for boys who have yet to reach puberty.\n\nPerviously, Seandel and Rafii wrote, researchers proposed preserving fertility in such patients by freezing their spermatogonial stem cells for later transplant, but that approach has not yet been tested in humans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSato\u2019s work suggests that freezing testicular tissue instead, and growing the sperm in the lab later for in vitro fertilization, could be another option. The commentary authors wrote that further work on the technique\u2019s safety would be needed before it would be ready for clinical use.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e1cd756/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2Fe1%2F9a5d332765dc9a82d02f60e42e9e%2Fimg-53607350-turbine-la-bio-eryn-brown", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eryn Brown Previously Covered Healthcare For The Metro Desk.
