It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.\n\nCertain immune-system signaling molecules also target other tissues in the body, including in the eyes, which causes their bulging appearance, sometimes known as Graves\u2019 eyes. About 30 percent of people with Graves\u2019 disease develop mildly bulging eyes, and 2 to 5 percent develop severe bulge. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK.\n\nTeprotumumab blocks one of these immune signaling molecules, so researchers wanted to see what effect it might have on the eyes of Graves\u2019 patients with moderate to severe bulge.\n\nThe study \u201cincluded some of the worst cases imaginable and we\u2019re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,\u201d Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.\n\nBy week 24, the response rate was 69 percent with the drug and 20 percent with placebo. Among those who completed therapy, the rates were 79 percent and 22 percent, respectively.\n\nMore people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note.\n\nHowever, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks.\n\nHigh blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.\n\nThe typical treatment for Graves\u2019 eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes.\n\nThe drug, also known as RV001 or R1507, has been developed by Genmab and Roche. River Vision Development Corporation licensed the drug from Roche. On Monday, Horizon Pharma announced that it was acquiring River Vision, which paid for the new study.\n\nSmith said FDA approval could come sometime in 2018. Enrollment in a follow-up trial is expected to begin within six weeks.\n\nThe duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, \u201cbut future studies will sort that out,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThe researchers also cautioned that the study only included volunteers with active disease of recent onset so \u201cthe potential of teprotumumab in benefiting patients with milder, less active, or stable disease was not assessed.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2qSTjSn New England Journal of Medicine, online May 3, 2017.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Emery", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-graves-eyes-drug-idUSKBN18523X", "title": "Experimental drug reduces thyroid-associated \u2018Graves' eyes\u2019", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
