The research was presented in May at the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health in Las Vegas. While the study was small and lacked a control group, Dr. Streeter and her colleagues are planning a randomized controlled trial to further test the intervention.\n\n\u201cThe findings were exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cThey show that a behavioral intervention can have effects of similar magnitude as an antidepressant.\u201d\n\nControlled breathing may also affect the immune system. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina divided a group of 20 healthy adults into two groups. One group was instructed to do two sets of 10-minute breathing exercises, while the other group was told to read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. The subjects\u2019 saliva was tested at various intervals during the exercise. The researchers found that the breathing exercise group\u2019s saliva had significantly lower levels of three cytokines that are associated with inflammation and stress. The findings were published in the journal BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine in August.\n\nHere are three basic breathing exercises to try on your own.\n\nCoherent Breathing\n\nIf you have the time to learn only one technique, this is the one to try. In coherent breathing, the goal is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing exercises before, you may have to work up to this practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/21/well/breathing1/breathing1-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/21/well/breathing1/breathing1-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/21/well/breathing1/breathing1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Alderman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/well/mind/breathe-exhale-repeat-the-benefits-of-controlled-breathing.html", "title": "Breathe.
