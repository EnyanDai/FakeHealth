The drug reduced by 87 percent the risk of disease progression or death.\n\nExcluding patients on placebo, the median survival without disease progression was 29 weeks.\n\nSide effects of cabozantinib included fatigue, high blood pressure and hemorrhage.\n\nMorrissey said Exelixis planned to start a Phase 3 prostate cancer trial in the second half of this year with a combined goal of reducing pain and bone malignancies.\n\nCabozantinib, also known as XL184, is an oral drug designed to limit blood supply to tumors and to block two segments of a pathway used by cancer cells to grow and spread.\n\nOther Phase 2 data presented over the weekend showed that treatment with cabozantinib led to significant tumor shrinkage in 24 percent of patients with metastatic ovarian cancer.\n\nBut two ovarian cancer patients died from cabozantinib-related side effects - one from bowel fistula and one from intestinal perforation.\n\nExelixis expects to have initial results around midyear from a pivotal trial of the drug as a treatment for thyroid cancer.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deena Beasley", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exelixis-prostate-idUSTRE7556IZ20110606", "title": "Exelixis drug slows prostate cancer spread in trial", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Exelixis Inc's cabozantinib experimental drug shrank bone malignancies from prostate cancer in 76 percent of patients, interim results from a midstage trial show.", "Author": "Deena Beasley", "keywords": "US,EXELIXIS,PROSTATE", "news_keywords": "US;EXELIXIS;PROSTATE", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Jun 06 21:42:03 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-06-06T21:42:03+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Deena Beasley", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exelixis-prostate-idUSTRE7556IZ20110606", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Exelixis drug slows prostate cancer spread in trial", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,EXELIXIS,PROSTATE", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-EXELIXIS-PROSTATE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Exelixis drug slows prostate cancer spread in trial", "sailthru.author": "Deena Beasley", "sailthru.date": "2011-06-06T21:42:03+0000", "sailthru.title": "Exelixis drug slows prostate cancer spread in trial", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Exelixis drug slows prostate cancer spread in trial", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exelixis-prostate-idUSTRE7556IZ20110606", "type": "article", "description": "Exelixis Inc's cabozantinib experimental drug shrank bone malignancies from...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-06-06T21:42:03+0000", "modified_time": "2011-06-06T21:42:03+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Deena Beasley", "tag": "US,EXELIXIS,PROSTATE"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Exelixis drug slows prostate cancer spread in trial", "description": "Exelixis Inc's cabozantinib experimental drug shrank bone malignancies from prostate cancer in 76 percent of patients, interim results from a midstage trial show.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1307332800.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
