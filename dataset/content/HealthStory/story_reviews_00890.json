It is possible, for instance, that patients were referred to stent use because they were too sick to withstand surgery, and that could be an important reason for the higher death rate among those patients.\n\nWilliam Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Delaware and the study's lead investigator, said the results call for more collaboration between heart surgeons who perform bypass surgeries and interventional cardiologists who deploy stents to make sure patients are carefully evaluated and informed of their options before their procedures.\n\nHe cautioned that all of the studies\u2014including the new one\u2014have limitations. \"I don't think anybody would say the results will completely change the way we do things,\" said Dr. Weintraub, who presented the results at the annual scientific meeting of the American College of Cardiology. They were also published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe gold standard for testing medical treatments is the randomized trial, in which patients are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group to spread patient differences evenly and avoid bias in results. But such trials typically have strict enrollment criteria and findings often can't be generalized to the broader population.\n\nRegistry studies such as the current one enable researchers to use accumulated data on the real-world experience of thousands of patients, but as the current study suggests, that doesn't necessarily resolve uncertainty over which treatment approach is better.\n\nThe result \"doesn't change much,\" said Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University, who wasn't involved in the study. \"It nudges you a little closer to surgery, but it's not a very big nudge.\"\n\nThe paper is based on data from Medicare beneficiaries included in an American College of Cardiology Foundation registry of patients who got angioplasty and stent procedures and in another database on bypass surgery maintained by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Medicare data are included as well.\n\nResearchers found that at one year after the procedures, death rates were about the same for surgery and stents, reflecting the higher risk of mortality from the open-heart procedure itself\u2014about 2% for surgery compared with about 1% for stenting. The short-term risk of surgery can affect patients' treatment decision, especially given the prospect of open-heart surgery and weeks of recovery, compared with a less-invasive angioplasty.\n\nThe new data suggest doctors can tell patients if they survive the surgery, they will live longer down the road, said Michael Crawford, clinical cardiology chief at University of California at San Francisco, who wasn't involved in the study. \"Some patients buy that. For some it's a tough sell.\"\n\nThe patients studied had heart disease in two or three of the vessels that provide blood to the heart. They were stable, and thus didn't need a procedure urgently. Currently, such patients could be candidates for either approach.\n\nKirk Garratt, director of research at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York and an interventional cardiologist who wasn't involved in the study, said patients who choose stents shouldn't think they're \"making a dreadful mistake\" about their care based on the new data.\n\nBut Fred Edwards, emeritus professor of surgery at University of Florida, Jacksonville, and a co-author of the study, said he thought the results favoring surgery \"should influence practice.\"\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com", "images":
