REUTERS/Ali Jarekji\n\nThe test, which uses conventional magnetic resonance imaging or MRI machines, detected 94 percent of individuals with a high-functioning form of autism, they reported on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThese results are the best yet in the search for a biological basis in terms of being able to distinguish those with and without the disease,\u201d said Nicholas Lange of Harvard Medical School, who directs the Neurostatistics Laboratory at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts.\n\nHe said the findings, published in the journal Autism Research, were very preliminary, but if confirmed in several more and larger studies, they might replace current subjective tests now used to diagnose the disorder.\n\nAnd, he said, they might also lead to better management and treatment of people with autism, a complex and mysterious brain disorder usually first diagnosed in early childhood.\n\nAutism is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding other people\u2019s emotions and behavior.\n\nFor the study, researchers at McLean and a team led by Dr. Janet Lainhart the University of Utah used an MRI that was tuned to pick up microscopic features of the brain\u2019s wiring \u2014 a technique known as diffusion tensor imaging.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need any fancy equipment. This is performed around the world,\u201d Lange said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe team did scans of this type on the brains of 30 people with autism and 30 people without.\n\nThey found that the brain circuitry is significantly different in those with autism compared to people with normal brain function, specifically in areas of the brain that are engaged in language and social and emotional functioning.\n\nBy measuring six aspects of the brain\u2019s circuitry, the test was able to correctly pick out people who had been diagnosed with autism with 94 percent accuracy.\n\nA repeat study using two different sets of subjects showed the same high level of performance.\n\nLange said the findings should help make the process of diagnosing autism more scientific because it would rely on a test rather than a subjective assessment.\n\nAnd it may also offer an early diagnosis, which could help affected children get earlier intervention, when it is most likely to do some good.\n\n\u201cThe basis of autism in the brain is very deep. There may be very little that one can actually change about the disorder for an individual with a severe case,\u201d Lange said.\n\n\u201cHowever, it has been shown that in the early stages of development, individuals have been aided by intense one-on-one caring to help them with language, social function with their peers and also with emotional problems,\u201d he said.\n\nAutism disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States and affect four times as many boys as girls.", "images": ["https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101202&t=2&i=264175879&w=1200&r=2010-12-02T153307Z_01_BTRE6B1177900_RTROPTP_0_JORDAN", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101202&t=2&i=264175879&r=2010-12-02T153307Z_01_BTRE6B1177900_RTROPTP_0_JORDAN&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101202&t=2&i=264175879&w=1200&r=2010-12-02T153307Z_01_BTRE6B1177900_RTROPTP_0_JORDAN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autism-test-idUSTRE6B10Y420101202", "title": "Brain scans accurate at spotting autism: U.S. study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "U.S. researchers are closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "United States,Cynthia Osterman,Janet Lainhart,Julie Steenhuysen,Nicholas Lange,US,AUTISM,TEST", "news_keywords": "United States;Cynthia Osterman;Janet Lainhart;Julie Steenhuysen;Nicholas Lange;US;AUTISM;TEST", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Dec 02 15:33:09 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-12-02T15:33:09+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autism-test-idUSTRE6B10Y420101202", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Brain scans accurate at spotting autism: U.S. study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Cynthia Osterman,Janet Lainhart,Julie Steenhuysen,Nicholas Lange,US,AUTISM,TEST", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-AUTISM-TEST", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Brain scans accurate at spotting autism: U.S. study", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2010-12-02T15:33:09+0000", "sailthru.title": "Brain scans accurate at spotting autism: U.S. study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Brain scans accurate at spotting autism: U.S. study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autism-test-idUSTRE6B10Y420101202", "type": "article", "description": "U.S. researchers are closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that c...", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101202&t=2&i=264175879&w=1200&r=2010-12-02T153307Z_01_BTRE6B1177900_RTROPTP_0_JORDAN", "article": {"published_time": "2010-12-02T15:33:09+0000", "modified_time": "2010-12-02T15:33:09+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "United States,Cynthia Osterman,Janet Lainhart,Julie Steenhuysen,Nicholas Lange,US,AUTISM,TEST"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brain scans accurate at spotting autism: U.S. study", "description": "U.S. researchers are closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101202&t=2&i=264175879&w=1200&r=2010-12-02T153307Z_01_BTRE6B1177900_RTROPTP_0_JORDAN", "src": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101202&t=2&i=264175879&w=1200&r=2010-12-02T153307Z_01_BTRE6B1177900_RTROPTP_0_JORDAN"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
