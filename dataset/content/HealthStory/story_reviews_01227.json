It kills 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people around the world.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-breast-screening-sb-idUSTRE70P0MO20110126", "title": "New U.S. analysis backs annual breast screening", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "A new analysis of evidence used by a U.S. advisory panel to roll back breast cancer screening guidelines suggests it may have ignored evidence that more frequent mammograms save more lives, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "US,CANCER,BREAST,SCREENING,SB", "news_keywords": "US;CANCER;BREAST;SCREENING;SB", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Jan 26 17:26:45 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-01-26T17:26:45+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-breast-screening-sb-idUSTRE70P0MO20110126", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "New U.S. analysis backs annual breast screening", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,CANCER,BREAST,SCREENING,SB", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-BREAST-SCREENING-SB", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "New U.S. analysis backs annual breast screening", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2011-01-26T17:26:45+0000", "sailthru.title": "New U.S. analysis backs annual breast screening", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "New U.S. analysis backs annual breast screening", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-breast-screening-sb-idUSTRE70P0MO20110126", "type": "article", "description": "A new analysis of evidence used by a U.S. advisory panel to roll back breast can...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-01-26T17:26:45+0000", "modified_time": "2011-01-26T17:26:45+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "US,CANCER,BREAST,SCREENING,SB"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "New U.S. analysis backs annual breast screening", "description": "A new analysis of evidence used by a U.S. advisory panel to roll back breast cancer screening guidelines suggests it may have ignored evidence that more frequent mammograms save more lives, U.S. resea...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1296062805.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
