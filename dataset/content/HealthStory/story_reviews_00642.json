The women who took the 10-week stress-management class shortly after surgery reported feeling better and having fewer depressive symptoms such as anxiety than those who took a one-day, breast-cancer education session.\n\nJamie Stagl worries that women with breast cancer don't get enough help coping with their diagnosis. Cancer upends a woman's daily routine, her sense of her body, her vision of the future. There's almost nothing more stressful.\n\nThe women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and \u2014 according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer \u2014 an average of 11 years later. (Stagl and her colleagues tracked down 100 of the original participants; another 30 had died; and 110 couldn't be found or didn't want to participate.)\n\nThe positive results surprised even Stagl. \"It's quite amazing,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStagl doesn't know whether the women are still using the techniques they were taught \u2014 which include mindfulness, deep breathing, visual imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and learning how to ask for help from friends and family. But the study suggests that they have internalized the strategies.\n\nWomen may be particularly receptive to these approaches when they're coping with a cancer diagnosis, said Laura S. Porter, an associate professor at Duke University Medical Center. \"This is really a teachable moment.\"\n\nThe skills taught in the course are useful at many stressful moments, Porter said, not just when cancer is diagnosed. But most people aren't explicitly trained how to cope with stressful events.\n\n\"These are really good life skills,\" Porter said. \"While I certainly wouldn't say that anyone could take a 10-week course and be set for life, I think anyone could take a 10-week course and be much better at coping with stress.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext, the study team, led by Michael Antoni of the University of Miami, hopes to show that an easier-to-manage five-week group class works as well as the 10-week one.\n\nAnd researchers want to know whether relaxation actually reduces the recurrence of breast cancer. It makes biological sense, Stagl said. Stress drives up levels of the hormone cortisol, which is known to weaken the immune system. If a woman's stress level remains high indefinitely after diagnosis, she may have a worse outcome than if she can bring it back down, Stagl said.\n\nKAREN WEINTRAUB", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035042&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/ tr?id=884869448226452&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6PMFmRYJKvAh0C7WYe7o6Azd2Zc=/506x0/www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg"], "top_img": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6PMFmRYJKvAh0C7WYe7o6Azd2Zc=/506x0/www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2015/04/03/deepbreath/9ZLuo38hJKJQUJbxn3yX5I/story.html", "title": "Managing the stress of cancer", "meta_data": {"description": "Lessons on relaxation techniques and coping strategies help breast-cancer patients years after their treatments ends.", "keywords": "Deep breath,stress management,cancer patients,stress-management classes,women with cancer", "robots": "noarchive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-config": "/pf/resources/images/icons/browserconfig.xml?d=109", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "type": "article", "title": "Managing the stress of cancer - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2015/04/03/deepbreath/9ZLuo38hJKJQUJbxn3yX5I/story.html", "description": "Lessons on relaxation techniques and coping strategies help breast-cancer patients years after their treatments ends.", "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6PMFmRYJKvAh0C7WYe7o6Azd2Zc=/506x0/www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg", "pixelID": 884869448226452}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BostonGlobe", "title": "Managing the stress of cancer - The Boston Globe", "description": "Lessons on relaxation techniques and coping strategies help breast-cancer patients years after their treatments ends.", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/2015/04/03/deepbreath/9ZLuo38hJKJQUJbxn3yX5I/story.html", "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/6PMFmRYJKvAh0C7WYe7o6Azd2Zc=/506x0/www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg"}, "section": "Health"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1428033600.0, "source": "http://www.bostonglobe.com", "summary": ""}
