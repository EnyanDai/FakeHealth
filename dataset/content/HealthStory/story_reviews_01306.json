Those who exercised to piano music also showed improvements in balance and the manner or style of walking.\n\n\u201cEach year, one-third of the population 65 years and older experiences at least one fall, and half of those fall repeatedly,\u201d write researcher Andrea Trombetti, MD, of University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine of Geneva, Switzerland, and colleagues in the Archives of Internal Medicine. \u201cExercise can counteract key risk factors for falls, such as poor balance, and consequently reduce risk of falling in elderly community-dwelling individuals.\u201d\n\nResearchers say a large proportion of falls in elderly people occur while walking, so improving gait and balance can have a major impact on fall prevention.", "images":
