But the procedure had never been done in people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Dr. Todd Mainprize, a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto, announced at a news conference that he had successfully breached the blood-brain barrier in a 56-year-old Canadian woman whose brain tumor, diagnosed six years ago, had recently begun to grow.\n\nMainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed.\n\nThe microscopic bubbles \u2014 roughly the size of red blood cells \u2014 had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule.\n\nOn Friday, as scheduled, Hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor. No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.\n\nBecause the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said. In the trial at Sunnybrook \u2014 funded by the Virginia-based Focused Ultrasound Foundation \u2014 nine others are slated to receive the same procedure.\n\nCanadian doctors have successfully breached the blood-brain barrier to deliver chemotherapy to Bonny Hall, whose brain tumor had recently begun to grow. Sunnybrook/Doug Nicholson/Media Source\n\nSucceeding in getting drugs across the barrier is \u201ca huge achievement\u201d said Dr. Nathan McDannold, a radiologist at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat 15 years ago in animals.\n\nBut it\u2019s just one of many. New, safe doses of drugs will need to be determined, once medication is not being diverted by the blood-brain barrier, noted Dr. Gordon Li, a neurosurgeon at Stanford. \u201cIf we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there,\u201d he said, \u201cit will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials.\u201d\n\nMainprize said the patient, a \u201cremarkable woman,\u201d was chosen to go first, because of the status and large size of her tumor, because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach, and because of her willingness to help the research.\n\nIn a prepared video, Hall said she just wants to get back to living her life. \u201cI want to be a normal housewife \u2026 a normal grandma.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BloodBrainBarrier_151105_040-1024x576.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BloodBrainBarrier_151105_040-645x645.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsletter-Logo-Images-DR.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/stat-logo.svg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/plugins/stat-lazy-load/images/330x400-00000000.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BloodBrainBarrier_151105_252-768x513.jpg", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=46858&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=436331036555416&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BloodBrainBarrier_151105_040-1024x576.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Weintraub", "Shraddha Chakradhar", "Sharon Begley", "Megan Thielking", "Elizabeth Preston", "Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/10/ultrasound-brain-tumor/", "title": "Brain tumor breached with ultrasound in medical first", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "origin", "description": "Using tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound, Canadian doctors have succeeded in delivering chemotherapy deep inside a cancer patient\u2019s brain.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brain tumor breached with ultrasound in medical first", "description": "Using tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound, Canadian doctors have succeeded in delivering chemotherapy deep inside a cancer patient\u2019s brain.", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/10/ultrasound-brain-tumor/", "site_name": "STAT", "updated_time": "2017-08-25T19:25:36+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BloodBrainBarrier_151105_040-1024x576.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BloodBrainBarrier_151105_040-1024x576.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "tag": "ultrasound", "section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-11-10T21:43:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-25T19:25:36+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Using tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound, Canadian doctors have succeeded in delivering chemotherapy deep inside a cancer patient\u2019s brain.", "title": "Brain tumor breached with ultrasound in medical first", "site": "@statnews", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BloodBrainBarrier_151105_040-1024x576.jpg", "creator": "@kweintraub"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/10/ultrasound-brain-tumor/?ia_markup=1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1324796990", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-328x328.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1447131600.0, "source": "http://www.statnews.com", "summary": ""}
