But in a new study the kids who consumed the fermented dairy product did no better, based on number of stools produced, than youngsters in a comparison group.\n\nThe study examined 159 children with constipation for at least two months with a defecation rate of less than three times per week. About half were given the probiotic product twice daily for three weeks; children in the comparison group were given a dairy product without the probiotic.", "images":
