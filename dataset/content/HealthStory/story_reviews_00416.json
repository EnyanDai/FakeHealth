However, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend a CA125 test plus vaginal ultrasound imaging for a woman with nonspecific symptoms that could signal ovarian cancer, such as bloating and pain. A CT or MRI scan may be added, although these are expensive. A biopsy is usually avoided because it could spread cancer cells.", "images": ["https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/fKm4SllKk6mkn6M0rH7ozwenANs=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/i3mnilTqn2z9vW9ouYlNz3GOrA8=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/Ez84kgUgjU2C6pK1LR4TAN4RdFk=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TIPHVUOBW5ETJKB4N4I7T5GXRQ.jpg", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/F-N8i3PLND7jI2semtOn2AwLUlE=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/QhsSiv5Pp6R9UYYdEXuIxRWg5vk=/150x150/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/inquirer/covers/inqFrontPage.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/P0EHv7XwRp9Ip-NEdUO9xOVtfow=/500x500/left/top/media.inquirer.com/storage/dailynews/covers/front.jpg%3Fd=20191111-13", "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/FS3cAAL4Ovy2QZBEqmhkIR5m_38=/1400x932/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TIPHVUOBW5ETJKB4N4I7T5GXRQ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/i3mnilTqn2z9vW9ouYlNz3GOrA8=/1200x0/center/middle/www.inquirer.com/resizer/Ez84kgUgjU2C6pK1LR4TAN4RdFk=/1200x0/center/middle/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-pmn.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TIPHVUOBW5ETJKB4N4I7T5GXRQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marie Mccullough", "Staff Writer", "Drew A.
