REUTERS/Jeff Zelevansky\n\nMerck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company\u2019s share price.\n\nJanuvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin that helps lower blood sugar levels, had sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet\n\nOn the study\u2019s main focus, after about three years 11.4 percent of Januvia patients had experienced cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina versus 11.6 percent in the placebo group.\n\nThe detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs. There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cWe can be reassured we can use this drug for glucose lowering without affecting the already high cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes,\u201d said Professor Rury Holman, the study\u2019s lead investigator, who presented the data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Boston.\n\n\u201cFor the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),\u201d he added.\n\nThere was also no significant difference between Januvia and placebo in infections, cancer, kidney failure or severe hypoglycemia, which is dangerously low blood sugar, researchers reported.\n\nAcute pancreatitis, a concern with some diabetes drugs, was uncommon but higher with Januvia, 23 versus 12. That was not statistically significant.\n\n\u201cNumerically this is hardly a major risk, just something we need to keep an eye on,\u201d Holman said.\n\nPancreatic cancers, also uncommon, were numerically fewer with Januvia, 9 versus 14.\n\nDeath from any cause occurred in 7.5 percent of Januvia patients versus 7.3 percent for placebo.\n\nThe Tecos heart safety study was conducted by an independent academic research collaboration between the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke University Clinical Research Institute. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.", "images": ["http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150608&t=2&i=1054725399&r=LYNXMPEB57109&w=20", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150608&t=2&i=1054725399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEB57109"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150608&t=2&i=1054725399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEB57109", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Berkrot", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-diabetes-merck-idUSKBN0OO2EF20150608", "title": "No heart safety issues seen with Merck Januvia diabetes drug: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "medical-research;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;drug-pricing1", "description": "Details of a large heart safety study presented on Monday appear to give Merck and Co's diabetes drug Januvia a clean bill of health, possibly setting the stage for a return to sales growth for the drugmaker's biggest product.", "Author": "Bill Berkrot", "keywords": "Rury Holman,US,DIABETES,MERCK,Heart / Cardiac Disease,Company News,Health / Medicine,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Corporate Events,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Diabetes,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States", "news_keywords": "Rury Holman;US;DIABETES;MERCK;Heart / Cardiac Disease;Company News;Health / Medicine;Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);Corporate Events;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Diabetes;Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Jun 08 20:37:24 UTC 2015", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2015-06-08T20:37:24+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Bill Berkrot", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-diabetes-merck-idUSKBN0OO2EF20150608", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "No heart safety issues seen with Merck Januvia diabetes drug: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Rury Holman,US,DIABETES,MERCK,Heart / Cardiac Disease,Company News,Health / Medicine,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Corporate Events,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Diabetes,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-DIABETES-MERCK", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "No heart safety issues seen with Merck Januvia diabetes drug: study", "sailthru.author": "Bill Berkrot", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-08T20:37:24+0000", "sailthru.title": "No heart safety issues seen with Merck Januvia diabetes drug: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "No heart safety issues seen with Merck Januvia diabetes drug: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-diabetes-merck-idUSKBN0OO2EF20150608", "type": "article", "description": "Details of a large heart safety study presented on Monday appear to give Merck a...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150608&t=2&i=1054725399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEB57109", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-08T20:37:24+0000", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T20:37:24+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Bill Berkrot", "tag": "Rury Holman,US,DIABETES,MERCK,Heart / Cardiac Disease,Company News,Health / Medicine,Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Corporate Events,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Diabetes,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "No heart safety issues seen with Merck Januvia diabetes drug: study", "description": "Details of a large heart safety study presented on Monday appear to give Merck and Co's diabetes drug Januvia a clean bill of health, possibly setting the stage for a return to sales growth for t...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150608&t=2&i=1054725399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEB57109", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150608&t=2&i=1054725399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEB57109"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tentpoles/AdvancingForward/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
