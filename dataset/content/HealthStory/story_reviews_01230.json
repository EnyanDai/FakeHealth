Patel, MD, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, U.K., and an author of the case study.\n\nPatel says that makes the impact of the case study \u201cstartling and exciting\u201d because if studies bear the findings out, deep brain stimulation may one day help people with hypertension whose blood pressure remains uncontrolled on multiple medications.\n\nThe case study is published in the Jan. 25 issue of Neurology.\n\nWhile the case study is only an example of the phenomenon occurring in a single person, previous reports have observed the same kinds of reductions in blood pressure in people getting deep brain stimulation for pain, though researchers had believed that the blood pressure benefit was directly tied to the degree of pain relief the person experienced.\n\n\u201cWhat their case report shows is that blood pressure can be reduced in a sustained fashion in a patient with unsuccessful deep brain stimulation for pain,\u201d says Erlick Pereira, MD, a neurosurgeon at the University of Oxford. Pereira wrote about blood pressure reductions in a patient getting deep brain stimulation in the January 2010 issue of the Journal of Clinical Neuroscience.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s important because it paves the way for potentially studying patients without chronic pain and offering the treatment sometime in the future to reduce blood pressure,\u201d he says.", "images":
