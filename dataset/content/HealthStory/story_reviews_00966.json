Eight months later, none of the tumors had come back.\n\nTumors shrank or stopped growing in the other nine patients, says study researcher Claudio Pusceddu, MD, a specialist in radiation and oncology at Oncological Hospital in Cagliari, Italy.\n\nDuring microwave ablation, radiologists place a thin microwave antenna directly into the tumor. An electromagnetic wave then agitates water molecules in the surrounding tumor tissue, producing friction and heat that eventually destroy the tumor.\n\nThe procedure, which costs about $2,000, takes about an hour, and the patient is typically kept overnight in the hospital for observation.\n\nU.S. researchers say the technique certainly shows promise. But more patients have to be followed for far longer to see if they stay in remission, they say.\n\nThe findings were presented here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.", "images":
