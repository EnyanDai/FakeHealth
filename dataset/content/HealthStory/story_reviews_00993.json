Since the surgery is tricky and time-consuming, fewer than 10% of hair-restoration surgeons do it. Most simply remove a whole strip of scalp and separate out the follicles under a microscope. Strip surgery is painful and takes weeks or months to heal versus just a couple of days\u2019 healing time and less scarring with individual follicular-unit extraction, Harris says.\n\nThe new ARTAS robot decides which follicles to collect and plucks them out as the doctor stands by to check its work. The surgeon can watch from the same room or via a remote monitor.\n\nHarris says the time passes quickly as he watches the robot do its thing: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly less tedious than doing it by hand. It allows me to think more about the other things I\u2019m going to do with the patient.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe robot halves the surgery time, Harris says, and surgeons can be trained in its use in a couple of days, rather than the two to three years it took him to perfect the by-hand operation.\n\nHarris developed a blade for the drill tip that the machine uses to punch out follicles without damaging them and licensed it to Restoration Robotics Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., the company that makes ARTAS. His office is one of two that tested a prototype of the machine.\n\nHarris was so impressed he became the first hair-restoration specialist to install the ARTAS robot, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year. He and his fellow testers have already put more than 350 heads under the machine\u2019s care, with no complications, he says.\n\nSince collecting follicles one by one directly from the scalp is so time-consuming and difficult, physicians that do it charge $5,000 to $10,000, Harris says. The robot cost $200,000, but because it saves him time, Harris offers patients a discount if they let ARTAS do the follicle extraction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014Amber Dance", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-robotic-surgery-hair-20111017-story.html", "title": "Robot-assisted hair restoration?", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Robot-assisted hair restoration?", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-robotic-surgery-hair-20111017-story.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "lat-logo-dark-full.jpg"}, "description": "A robot could gather hair follicles for transplant quicker, cheaper and with less pain for the patient, according to a hair-transplant specialist who has used a prototype.", "site_name": "Los Angeles Times", "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "published_time": "2014-03-20T02:19:49", "opinion": "false", "tag": "Health"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A robot could gather hair follicles for transplant quicker, cheaper and with less pain for the patient, according to a hair-transplant specialist who has used a prototype.", "site": "@latimes", "title": "Robot-assisted hair restoration?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 119932621434123, "pages": 5863113009}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "description": "A robot could gather hair follicles for transplant in less time, at a lower cost and with less pain for the patient, according to a hair-transplant specialist who has tested a prototype.", "brightspot.contentId": "00000169-0c88-dbbe-a16f-4ee85ee70000", "brightspot.cached": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1395296389.0, "source": "http://www.latimes.com", "summary": ""}
