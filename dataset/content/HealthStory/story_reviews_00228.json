Ten years ago, scientists started looking at the hormones made in the pituitary gland to see how they act on certain targets. They found some of these hormones had an effect on bone mass.\n\nSubscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week\n\nMatt Cardy/Getty\n\nFrom this, they created an antibody to see if it could be used to prevent bone loss in mice\u2014and in 2010, they showed it could. As a result, they started considering it as a potential treatment for osteoporosis, particularly in post-menopausal women\u2014a period when women lose bone mass fairly quickly.\n\nBut scientists also realized it could have other uses. Mone Zaidi, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, is one of the authors on the latest study into how the antibody triggers weight loss. \u201cOsteoporosis and obesity are fairly closely linked in several ways,\u201d he tells Newsweek. \u201cWomen, when they undergo menopause, lose bone and gain body fat. So we thought maybe there was a connection\u2014that FSH could have direct effects on adipose tissue.\u201d\n\nIn the study, published in Nature, scientists injected the antibody into mice that had had their ovaries removed (mimicking menopause) and mice that had been fed on a high-fat diet. In both cases, the antibody caused significant weight loss and gains in bone mass.\n\nZaidi says they looked at the adipose tissue in different areas of the body, including under the skin and around the vital organs. \u201cIn all compartments it was [fat] reduced by around this level. It\u2019s a fairly dramatic effect.\u201d Mice also showed increased oxygen consumption, higher levels of physical activity and more heat production in beige fat (which dissipates energy around the body).\n\nBut how do mice models translate to human treatments? Mice a fairly close genetic match to Humans, and Zaidi is hopeful there will be similar effects in humans.\n\nTheir next step is to \u201chumanize\u201d the antibody, so it can be tested without triggering an immune response. \u201cWe would then hopefully go to the next phase of preclinical testing, which would be to look at side effects, toxicology etc. After that, we would go into primates and larger animals. That would then lead\u2014if all goes well\u2014to the first human trials in three to four years.\u201d\n\nAt present, the researchers are focusing on the adiposity, rather than bone loss, for drug development: \u201cI think obesity is a more prevalent disease\u2014but osteoporosis at the tail end can be tagged on. Also to do trials for osteoporosis takes a very long time,\u201d Zaidi says.\n\nEventually, he hopes to end up with an injected drug that gets rid of fat and increases bone mass. \u201cThat\u2019s the ideal situation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could be a unique obesity drug. But it could also be a unique drug because it lowers body fat and makes bones stronger. And the population that could be most benefited by this could be post-menopausal women.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the research, Tim Speckor, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King\u2019s College London, U.K., says: \u201cIt\u2019s a nice mouse study that seems to work\u2014whether it works in humans is another matter.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2016/09/09/obesity.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-xs/public/2017/04/27/2017_05_05_cover_768_x_1024.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-xs/public/2017/04/18/20170428cover1800-x-2400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/subscribe_icon/public/subscribe/2017_05_26_cover_235x235.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2016/09/09/obesity.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-xs/public/2017/05/01/20170512cover1800x-2400.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-xs/public/2017/05/09/20170519cover1800x-2400.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/2016/09/09/obesity.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170525053613/http://www.newsweek.com/obesity-weight-loss-antibody-reduces-fat-614978", "title": "Obesity Cure?
