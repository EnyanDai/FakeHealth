The rate for 413 volunteers given placebo treatment was 7.7 percent.\n\nThe research team, led by Dr. Lonneke Bode of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, estimated that 250 patients would need to be screened to prevent one infection.\n\n\u201cPreventing one infection will pay for thousands of these screenings,\u201d Dr. Henri Verbrugh of Erasmus, a coauthor of the study, said in a telephone interview.\n\nInfections are also a problem when doctors put tubes into the body. Although his team did not evaluate enough patients to study the problem directly, \u201cWe feel this technology is capable of preventing those types of infections as well,\u201d Verbrugh said.\n\nA second infection study, also reported in the journal, found that a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination produced 41 percent fewer surgical-site infections as the commonly used mixture of povidone and iodine, which gives a yellow-orange tinge to the skin.\n\nIn a commentary, Dr. Richard Wenzel of the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond said the chlorhexidine-alcohol mixture should replace the older disinfectant when scrubbing people for surgery, and the nasal disinfection technique should primarily be used for people undergoing cardiac surgery, receiving an implant, or whose immune system is likely to be affected.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Emery", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-infection-prevention-idUSTRE6055J120100106", "title": "Nose treatment cuts hospital-acquired infections", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "If you're checking into the hospital for surgery, doctors may soon be swabbing your nose in an effort to prevent an infection from appearing after your operation.", "Author": "Gene Emery", "keywords": "US,INFECTION,PREVENTION", "news_keywords": "US;INFECTION;PREVENTION", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Jan 06 22:50:10 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-01-06T22:50:10+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Gene Emery", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-infection-prevention-idUSTRE6055J120100106", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Nose treatment cuts hospital-acquired infections", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,INFECTION,PREVENTION", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-INFECTION-PREVENTION", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Nose treatment cuts hospital-acquired infections", "sailthru.author": "Gene Emery", "sailthru.date": "2010-01-06T22:50:10+0000", "sailthru.title": "Nose treatment cuts hospital-acquired infections", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Nose treatment cuts hospital-acquired infections", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-infection-prevention-idUSTRE6055J120100106", "type": "article", "description": "If you're checking into the hospital for surgery, doctors may soon be swabb...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-01-06T22:50:10+0000", "modified_time": "2010-01-06T22:50:10+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Gene Emery", "tag": "US,INFECTION,PREVENTION"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Nose treatment cuts hospital-acquired infections", "description": "If you're checking into the hospital for surgery, doctors may soon be swabbing your nose in an effort to prevent an infection from appearing after your operation.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1262818210.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
