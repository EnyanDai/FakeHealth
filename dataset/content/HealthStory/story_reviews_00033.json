A detailed analysis would be submitted for presentation at a medical congress, it added.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-kidney-cancer-idUSKCN1LR1IY", "title": "Merck KGaA, Pfizer's immuno-drug shown to alleviate kidney cancer", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "medical-research;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Merck KGaA said that its immunotherapy Bavencio, jointly developed with Pfizer, delayed the progression of kidney cancer when used in combination with Pfizer's Inlyta drug in a late-stage study.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,MERCK,KIDNEY,CANCER,Germany,Switzerland,Company News,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Content produced in Bangalore,England,Europe,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Medical Regulatory Issues,Drug and Device Development,United States", "news_keywords": "US;MERCK;KIDNEY;CANCER;Germany;Switzerland;Company News;Health / Medicine;Western Europe;Content produced in Bangalore;England;Europe;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Medical Regulatory Issues;Drug and Device Development;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Sep 11 13:15:40 UTC 2018", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2018-09-11T13:15:40+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-kidney-cancer-idUSKCN1LR1IY", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Merck KGaA, Pfizer's immuno-drug shown to alleviate kidney cancer", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,MERCK,KIDNEY,CANCER,Germany,Switzerland,Company News,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Content produced in Bangalore,England,Europe,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Medical Regulatory Issues,Drug and Device Development,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-MERCK-KIDNEY-CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Merck KGaA, Pfizer's immuno-drug shown to alleviate kidney cancer", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2018-09-11T13:15:40+0000", "sailthru.title": "Merck KGaA, Pfizer's immuno-drug shown to alleviate kidney cancer", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Merck KGaA, Pfizer's immuno-drug shown to alleviate kidney cancer", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-kidney-cancer-idUSKCN1LR1IY", "type": "article", "description": "Merck KGaA said that its immunotherapy Bavencio, jointly developed with Pfizer, ...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2018-09-11T13:15:40+0000", "modified_time": "2018-09-11T13:15:40+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,MERCK,KIDNEY,CANCER,Germany,Switzerland,Company News,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Content produced in Bangalore,England,Europe,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Medical Regulatory Issues,Drug and Device Development,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Merck KGaA, Pfizer's immuno-drug shown to alleviate kidney cancer", "description": "Merck KGaA said that its immunotherapy Bavencio, jointly developed with Pfizer, delayed the progression of kidney cancer when used in combination with Pfizer's Inlyta drug in a late-stage study.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tentpoles/AdvancingForward/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
