The study had no industry funding.\n\nAlthough all the studies looked at soy supplements, Melby says that getting soy from food is a better bet.\n\n\"What this study shows is that ingesting soy isoflavones will help you,\" she says. \"I personally think foods [containing soy] are better.\"", "images":
