{"url": "http://www.Reuters.com/article/2011/05/10/us-lung-scans-idUSTRE74971L20110510", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - U.S. researchers say they have found clear signs that blood clots in the lungs are being overdiagnosed, exposing patients to potentially dangerous side effects from unnecessary drugs.\n\nUsing national data, the researchers found the rate of so-called pulmonary embolisms, or PEs, nearly doubled with the introduction of a new powerful diagnostic test more than a decade ago.\n\nYet there was only a slight drop in deaths from the condition over the same period, suggesting many of the clots were too small to cause harm.\n\n\u201cRather than an epidemic of disease, we think the increased incidence of PE reflects an epidemic of diagnostic testing that has created overdiagnosis,\u201d the researchers write in the Archives of Internal Medicine.\n\nIt\u2019s been estimated that more than 600,000 Americans have a pulmonary embolism each year. The condition usually occurs when a blood clot travels from the legs to the lungs, sometimes with fatal results.\n\nBut with increasingly sophisticated tools, doctors may be spotting clots that would never have been fatal in the first place.\n\nOne such tool is called a CT chest scan, which produces detailed images with high-dose x-rays and is being used in millions of patients every year in the U.S.\n\nIn the years before 1998, when the technique was introduced, 62 per 100,000 Americans were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism annually. After 1998, that number rose to 112 per 100,000.\n\nThe number of deaths caused by the condition dropped only little, however: from 12.3 per 100,000 in 1998 to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2006.\n\n\u201cThis is consistent with overdiagnosis of pulmonary embolisms that may have caused very little harm, may not have caused death,\u201d said Dr. Renda Soylemez Wiener of Boston University, who worked on the study.\n\nOn the other hand, the blood-thinning drugs used to treat blood clots increase the risk of bleeding in the brain or gastrointestinal tract, for example.\n\nAccording to the new results, such complications rose from three to five per 100,000 people hospitalized with PE per year after doctors began using chest CT scans.\n\nThe new findings add to other evidence showing that medical testing is on the rise across the U.S., although in many cases the impact on overall health remains unclear.\n\nCT scans expose patients to radiation, for example, which can increase the likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the scan also cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.\n\n\u201cI think doctors should think carefully about the pretest probability of a pulmonary embolism before they order this test,\u201d Wiener told Reuters Health.\n\nYet there is no easy solution at this point, because untreated blood clots can be fatal, she added.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is a difficult place for the patient to be in,\u201d Wiener said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/mmZK9K Archives of Internal Medicine, online May 9, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lung-scans-idUSTRE74971L20110510", "title": "Lung scans may lead to overdiagnosis: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - U.S. researchers say they have found clear signs that blood clots in the lungs are being overdiagnosed, exposing patients to potentially dangerous side effects from unnecessary drugs.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "US,LUNG,SCANS", "news_keywords": "US;LUNG;SCANS", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue May 10 21:27:41 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-05-10T21:27:41+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lung-scans-idUSTRE74971L20110510", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Lung scans may lead to overdiagnosis: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,LUNG,SCANS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-LUNG-SCANS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Lung scans may lead to overdiagnosis: study", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2011-05-10T21:27:41+0000", "sailthru.title": "Lung scans may lead to overdiagnosis: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Lung scans may lead to overdiagnosis: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lung-scans-idUSTRE74971L20110510", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - U.S. researchers say they have found clear signs that blood c...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-05-10T21:27:41+0000", "modified_time": "2011-05-10T21:27:41+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "US,LUNG,SCANS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Lung scans may lead to overdiagnosis: study", "description": "(Reuters Health) - U.S. researchers say they have found clear signs that blood clots in the lungs are being overdiagnosed, exposing patients to potentially dangerous side effects from unnecessary drug...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1305000000.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
