Not the smells of their colognes or perfumes, not of the laundry detergents they use \u2014 the smells of them?\n\nEach of us has a unique \u201codorprint\u201d made up of thousands of organic compounds. These molecules offer a whiff of who we are, revealing age, genetics, lifestyle, hometown \u2014 even metabolic processes that underlie our health.\n\nAncient Greek and Chinese medical practitioners used a patient\u2019s scent to make diagnoses. Modern medical research, too, confirms that the smell of someone\u2019s skin, breath and bodily fluids can be suggestive of illness. The breath of diabetics sometimes smells of rotten apples, experts report; the skin of typhoid patients, like baking bread.\n\nBut not every physician\u2019s nose is a precision instrument, and dogs, while adept at sniffing out cancer, get distracted. So researchers have been trying for decades to figure out how to build an inexpensive odor sensor for quick, reliable and noninvasive diagnoses.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/science/02SCENT/02SCENT-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/science/02SCENT/02SCENT-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/science/02SCENT/02SCENT-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Murphy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/artificial-nose-scent-disease.html", "title": "One Day, a Machine Will Smell Whether You\u2019re Sick", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-05-01T16:36:07.000Z", "modified": "2017-05-04T00:22:17.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/kate-murphy", "tag": "Monell Chemical Senses Center", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005017962, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/576ef525-b8da-5473-a4a5-2df1ff933f81", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/e352036bc1024fa282559bba8cfbcef9", "description": "Researchers are perfecting technology that sniffs out signs of disease in breath, blood and urine.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/science/02SCENT/02SCENT-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Kate Murphy", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/science/02SCENT/02SCENT-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Sense of Smell,Clinical trial,Sensor,Research,Nanotechnology,University of Pennsylvania,Technion,University of California, Davis,Monell Chemical Senses Center", "pdate": 20170501, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/artificial-nose-scent-disease.html", "type": "article", "title": "One Day, a Machine Will Smell Whether You\u2019re Sick", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/science/02SCENT/02SCENT-facebookJumbo.jpg", "description": "Researchers are perfecting technology that sniffs out signs of disease in breath, blood and urine."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/artificial-nose-scent-disease.html", "title": "One Day, a Machine Will Smell Whether You\u2019re Sick", "description": "Researchers are perfecting technology that sniffs out signs of disease in breath, blood and urine.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/science/02SCENT/02SCENT-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005017962"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/artificial-nose-scent-disease.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000005017962", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/artificial-nose-scent-disease.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/health/artificial-nose-scent-disease.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493611200.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
