Also, lab and animal studies suggest drugs that anticlotting drugs like aspirin may interfere with cancer growth and spread. So Choe and colleagues hypothesized that anticlotting drugs may lower the risk of dying among men with prostate cancer.\n\nThe study involved 5,275 men with localized cancer whose disease had not spread beyond the prostate gland; 1,982 of the men were taking anticlotting medications: aspirin, Lovenox, Plavix, and/or warfarin.\n\nBy 10 years after diagnosis, 10% of men not taking one of these medications had died from prostate cancer vs. 4% of those who took an anticlotting medication.\n\nThe risk that cancer spread was also reduced by anticlotting medications, from 7% to 3%. Also, 43% of men who didn\u2019t take anticlotting medications had a recurrence of their cancer, compared with 33% of men who did take them.\n\nMen who took aspirin gained the greatest benefit, Choe says.\n\nHarvard Medical School's Anthony Zietman, MD, president of ASTRO, tells WebMD that the findings are intriguing. However, they need to be confirmed, and the optimal dose, timing, and duration of use needs to be worked out, he says.\n\nAspirin and other anticlotting medications carry risks of their own, chiefly bleeding, Zietman says.\n\n\"We have to be sure the benefits outweigh the risks before we recommend this to patients.\"\n\nThis study was presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the \"peer review\" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.",
