Some women who test positive opt for prophylactic surgery to remove their breasts or ovaries.\n\n\"Women who test negative for BRCA don't require excessive interventions just because BRCA is in the family,\" said Allison Kurian, an assistant professor of both medicine and health research and policy at Stanford and lead author of the study.\n\nThe findings, published online Monday by the Journal of Clinical Oncology, are based on an analysis of 3,047 families, including 292 with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, enrolled in a breast-cancer family registry. Researchers said it was the largest study yet undertaken to assess breast-cancer risk among non-carriers of inheritable mutations.\n\nThe results support current guidelines that say non-BRCA mutation carriers in families affected by the BRCA genes don't need special screening beyond mammography as recommended for the general population, and needn't consider preventive surgery.\n\nThe BRCA mutations are associated with a five-fold risk of getting breast cancer and a 20-fold risk of ovarian cancer compared with people without the mutations, according to the National Cancer Institute. The chance that women who inherent the genes will get breast cancer during their lives is 45% to 65%; the likelihood is 11% to 40% for ovarian cancer.\n\nThe heightened risk has prompted women whose mothers or sisters were diagnosed with BRCA-positive tumors to get tested themselves, with the assumption that a negative test meant their chances of developing the cancers was low.\n\nThat's why the 2007 study was so troubling. It \"cast doubt on the whole meaning of a negative test result,\" Dr. Kurian said. \"We all see genetic tests as giving relatives an out when it's negative.\"\n\nDr. Kurian said the earlier study had methodological flaws that may have led to an overestimate of risk for non-BRCA carriers.\n\nSeveral other published studies have subsequently contradicted the 2007 findings. Monday's study, though, is special because it is population-based, not based on patients going to a clinic. Therefore it has a broader representation of mutation-carrying families, said Mark Robson, clinic director of the clinical genetics service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Dr. Robson, who wasn't an involved in the study but his team did a study that also contradicted the 2007 research, wrote an editorial accompanying it.\n\nEric Winer, chief of the division of women's cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston who wasn't involved in the current research, said the study shows that for women in families with an inherited breast-cancer gene but who don't inherit it, the risk of developing cancer does not appear to be significantly increased. They may still face a slightly elevated risk because they have a family member with the disease.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com and Shirley S.
