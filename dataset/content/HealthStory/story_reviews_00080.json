REUTERS/Robert Galbraith\n\nThe 12-week trial, presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, involved 246 patients suffering four to 14 migraine headaches a month who had tried two to four preventive treatments that either did not work for them or had intolerable side effects.\n\n\u201cThis is a trial in really difficult to treat patients,\u201d professor Uwe Reuter, trial investigator and managing medical director at Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin in Berlin, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments.\n\nReuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies.\n\nAimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. A decision by the FDA is due by May 17.\n\nAmgen has partnered with Novartis AG to co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States, while Amgen has rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has rights to commercialize in rest of world. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial.\n\nSimilar drugs are under development at companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but Amgen emphasizes that Aimovig is the only one that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself.\n\nAimovig has the \u201cpotential to help fill treatment gaps in more difficult patient populations whose migraine has not been adequately managed with current therapies,\u201d Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a statement.\n\nAmgen said Aimovig trial patients also had statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in secondary trial goals including fewer monthly migraine days and better physical function.\n\nResearchers said no Aimovig patients stopped treatment due to side effects, while around 1 percent of placebo patients discontinued because of side effects.\n\nAnalytics firm GlobalData has forecast that CGRP antibodies will generate combined sales of $4 billion by 2026.", "images":
