When we started, the technology wasn\u2019t very good and the functionality was limited, and it took a number of generations to move to the device that we have now. I see the same thing with this system.\u201d\n\nThe Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said last month it was teaming up with U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson\u2019s unit Animas, which makes insulin pumps, and DexCom Inc, which makes continuous glucose monitoring devices, to develop and test an artificial pancreas system.\n\nThe Cambridge study, published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday, used devices and sensors from Smiths Medical, a unit of Smiths Group, Abbott Diabetes Care, a unit of Abbott Laboratories, and Medtronic.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to create a device that can check patients blood day and night, during and between meals, and deliver insulin as required.\n\nThe Cambridge study found their device performed better than a conventional pump, which delivers insulin at pre-set rates and which kept blood sugar levels around normal for 40 percent of the time compared with 60 percent for the artificial pancreas.\n\nHovorka said the findings were particularly encouraging because the study included nights when the children went to bed after eating a large evening meal or having done exercise \u2014 both of which can affect blood sugar levels.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-diabetes-pancreas-idUSTRE61401720100205", "title": "Test of \"artificial pancreas\" offers diabetes hope", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "scienceNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "scienceNews;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Scientists have used an \"artificial pancreas\" system of pumps and monitors to improve blood sugar control in diabetes patients in the first study to show the new device works better than conventional treatment.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "Britain,United States,Philippa Fletcher,Kate Kelland,Roman Hovorka,US,DIABETES,PANCREAS", "news_keywords": "Britain;United States;Philippa Fletcher;Kate Kelland;Roman Hovorka;US;DIABETES;PANCREAS", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Feb 05 00:10:58 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-02-05T00:10:58+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-diabetes-pancreas-idUSTRE61401720100205", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Test of \"artificial pancreas\" offers diabetes hope", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Britain,United States,Philippa Fletcher,Kate Kelland,Roman Hovorka,US,DIABETES,PANCREAS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-DIABETES-PANCREAS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Test of \"artificial pancreas\" offers diabetes hope", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2010-02-05T00:10:58+0000", "sailthru.title": "Test of \"artificial pancreas\" offers diabetes hope", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Test of \"artificial pancreas\" offers diabetes hope", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-diabetes-pancreas-idUSTRE61401720100205", "type": "article", "description": "Scientists have used an \"artificial pancreas\" system of pumps and moni...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-02-05T00:10:58+0000", "modified_time": "2010-02-05T00:10:58+0000", "section": "Technology", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "Britain,United States,Philippa Fletcher,Kate Kelland,Roman Hovorka,US,DIABETES,PANCREAS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Test of \"artificial pancreas\" offers diabetes hope", "description": "Scientists have used an \"artificial pancreas\" system of pumps and monitors to improve blood sugar control in diabetes patients in the first study to show the new device works better than con...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tech/science/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article -
