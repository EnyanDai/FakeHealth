The test had particularly good results for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, though the number of cancers detected was small.\n\nResearchers hope the test will become part of a \u201cuniversal screening\u201d tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients.\n\n\u201cThis is potentially the holy grail of cancer research, to find cancers that are currently hard to cure at an earlier stage when they are easier to cure,\u201d said Dr Eric Klein, lead author of the research from Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Taussig Cancer Institute. \u201cWe hope this test could save many lives.\u201d\n\nThe study, by a research team that also included scientists from Stanford University, was presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists in Chicago.\n\nSimon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said \u201cnew techniques\u201d such as cancer blood tests could \u201cunlock enormous survival gains, as well as dramatic productivity benefits in the practice of medicine\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow, as the NHS marks its 70th anniversary, we stand on the cusp of a new era of personalised medicine that will dramatically transform care for cancer and for inherited and rare diseases,\u201d said Stevens.\n\nThe research scrutinised the cases of more than 1,600 people, 749 of whom were cancer-free at the time of the study, with no diagnosis, and 878 of whom had been newly diagnosed with a disease.\n\nThe test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic, ovarian, liver and gallbladder cancers, correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients.\n\nThe blood test found lymphoma and myeloma with slightly less accuracy, at 77% and 73%, and bowel cancer in two out of three patients. Lung cancer was detected in 59% of patients. Head and neck cancer was detected in 56% of patients.\n\nResearchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer, but noted further \u201cclinical development\u201d was needed.\n\nThe number of patients in whom cancers were detected was small. For example, although the test detected ovarian cancer with 90% accuracy, only 10 ovarian cancers in total were detected.\n\nNevertheless, researchers aim to develop a tool that could be used by for all people regardless of their family history. \u201cPotentially this test could be used for everybody,\u201d said Klein.\n\nProf Nicholas Turner from the Institute of Cancer Research in London described the findings as really exciting and as a possible universal screening tool. \u201cFar too many cancers are picked up too late, when it is no longer possible to operate and the chances of survival are slim,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to develop a blood test, such as this one, that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages.\u201d\n\nKlein added: \u201cIt is several steps away and more research is needed, but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age, such as those over 40, to see if they have early signs of cancer.\u201d", "images":
