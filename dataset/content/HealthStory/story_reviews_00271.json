A small new study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience suggests that one easy way for older adults to get deeper sleep and stronger memories is to listen to a certain soothing sound called \u201cpink noise\u201d\u2014a mix of high and low frequencies that sounds more balanced and natural than its better-known cousin, \u201cwhite noise.\u201d\n\nIt may sound strange, but previous studies have found that playing so-called pink noise during sleep improves the memory of younger adults. \u201cWe wanted to see if it would work in older people, too,\u201d says senior author Dr. Phyllis Zee, professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.\n\nZee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.\n\nOn one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. \u201cThe noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,\u201d says Zee. \u201cIt\u2019s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it\u2019s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.\u201d The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.\n\n(Here\u2019s what pink noise sounded like to study participants, in the box below.)\n\nAfter analyzing everyone\u2019s sleep waves, the team found that people\u2019s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. On the nights without the noise, memory recall did not improve as much.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. The researchers hope to develop an affordable device that people can use at home.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Music, nature sounds and white (or pink) noise apps may still help improve sleep, she says\u2014which, in itself, is good for the body and for the brain.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/time-health-stock-sleep-hair.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/college-students-sleep.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/napping-heart-health.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/time-health-stock-sleep-hair.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Macmillan"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4694555/pink-noise-deep-sleep-improve-memory/", "title": "The Sound of \u2018Pink Noise\u2019 Improves Sleep and Memory", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "sleep", "news_keywords": "sleep, memory, white noise, pink noise, deep sleep, brain waves, memory consolidation, nature sounds", "description": "When researchers synched up soothing pink noise with deep-sleep brain waves, they saw big improvements in next-day memory.", "og": {"title": "The Sound of 'Pink Noise' Improves Sleep and Memory", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4694555/pink-noise-deep-sleep-improve-memory/", "description": "Researchers synched up soothing pink noise with deep-sleep brain waves", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/time-health-stock-sleep-hair.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4694555/pink-noise-deep-sleep-improve-memory/", "description": "When researchers synched up soothing pink noise with deep-sleep brain waves, they saw big improvements in next-day memory.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/time-health-stock-sleep-hair.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4694555/pink-noise-deep-sleep-improve-memory/", "title": "The Sound of 'Pink Noise' Improves Sleep and Memory", "description": "Researchers synched up soothing pink noise with deep-sleep brain waves", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/time-health-stock-sleep-hair.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
