The next goal is to test it in children.\n\n\u201cWhat we are working on now is to see if we find the same results in younger people,\u201d research leader Declan Murphy, professor of psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWe would hope that it would work just as well ... there is no reason why not.\u201d\n\nTREATMENT\n\nThe ability to base a diagnosis on an objective biological test, rather than having to rely on personality traits, should mean patients get treatment more quickly, he added.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy and educational treatment can be highly effective for some patients and the impact of a more certain prognosis would be especially beneficial for children.\n\nMurphy and colleagues, who published their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience, studied 20 healthy adults and another 20 individuals previously diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which also includes Asperger syndrome.\n\nThe accuracy of the scan in predicting autism was so high that the results were strongly significant, despite the small number of patients involved.\n\nExperts not involved in the research applauded the research but cautioned further study was still needed.\n\n\u201cAlthough this method is not ready for normal diagnostic situations, any step to easier diagnosis is welcome,\u201d said Terry Brugha, professor of psychiatry at the University of Leicester.\n\nMurphy said he envisaged that in future autism specialists would use a scan alongside interviews, in much the same way as doctors monitoring diabetes look at blood test results alongside patient histories.\n\nThe new system works by analyzing variations in the shape and structure of brain regions linked to language and social behavior, using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines made by companies like General Electric, Siemens and Philips.\n\nThe speed of the test makes it some 20 times cheaper than traditional tests, which can take a team of doctors four to eight hours to conduct. The actual brain scan costs around 100 pounds ($157.5).\n\nAutism spectrum disorders are diagnosed in one percent of the population in Britain and the United States, and the condition affects four times as many boys as girls. Researchers agree there is a strong genetic component.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ben Hirschler", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autism-scan-idUSTRE6795I420100810", "title": "Quick brain scan could screen for autism", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "A 15-minute brain scan could in future be used to test for autism, helping doctors diagnose the complex condition more cheaply and accurately.", "Author": "Ben Hirschler", "keywords": "Britain,United States,Jon Boyle,Ben Hirschler,Declan Murphy,Psychiatry,Terry Brugha,US,AUTISM,SCAN", "news_keywords": "Britain;United States;Jon Boyle;Ben Hirschler;Declan Murphy;Psychiatry;Terry Brugha;US;AUTISM;SCAN", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Aug 10 21:34:30 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-08-10T21:34:30+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Ben Hirschler", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autism-scan-idUSTRE6795I420100810", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Quick brain scan could screen for autism", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Britain,United States,Jon Boyle,Ben Hirschler,Declan Murphy,Psychiatry,Terry Brugha,US,AUTISM,SCAN", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-AUTISM-SCAN", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Quick brain scan could screen for autism", "sailthru.author": "Ben Hirschler", "sailthru.date": "2010-08-10T21:34:30+0000", "sailthru.title": "Quick brain scan could screen for autism", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Quick brain scan could screen for autism", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autism-scan-idUSTRE6795I420100810", "type": "article", "description": "A 15-minute brain scan could in future be used to test for autism, helping docto...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-08-10T21:34:30+0000", "modified_time": "2010-08-10T21:34:30+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Ben Hirschler", "tag": "Britain,United States,Jon Boyle,Ben Hirschler,Declan Murphy,Psychiatry,Terry Brugha,US,AUTISM,SCAN"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Quick brain scan could screen for autism", "description": "A 15-minute brain scan could in future be used to test for autism, helping doctors diagnose the complex condition more cheaply and accurately.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1281476070.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
