But the data from the Phase II, 180-patient trial represents a major milestone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long trip but it\u2019s finally at the point that it\u2019s beyond a doubt, the oral insulin works,\u201d Nadav Kidron, chief executive of Jerusalem-based Oramed, said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe 28-day study involved patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled by metformin. They were dosed before bed time and had their overnight glucose levels continuously monitored. Those who received the oral insulin had a mean night-time glucose reduction of nearly 6.5 percent compared with a placebo.\n\nThere were no reported serious adverse side effects and no issues with hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, the company said. Oramed said it plans to publish more detailed data from the study once it has had time to analyze the full results.\n\nWhile insulin is typically associated with type 1 diabetes, many patients with type 2 eventually see their disease progress to the point where they need insulin. Type 2 accounts for more than 90 percent of the nearly 400 million people with diabetes worldwide.\n\nA safe and effective oral insulin, if approved, is expected to become a multibillion-dollar product.\n\nThe main attraction of an insulin pill, aside from avoiding injections, is that it comes much closer to the path of natural insulin, which is produced in the pancreas and goes directly to the liver. ORMD-0801 goes from the gut to the liver, while injected insulin circulates throughout the body before it gets there.\n\nSome doctors believe high levels of insulin circulating through the rest of the body may increase health risks.", "images": ["https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160518&t=2&i=1137742518&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEC4H0QZ", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160518&t=2&i=1137742518&r=LYNXNPEC4H0QZ&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160518&t=2&i=1137742518&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEC4H0QZ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Berkrot", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oramed-insulin-idUSKCN0Y91F2", "title": "Oramed says oral insulin succeeds in midstage type 2 diabetes trial", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "medical-research;companies-mrch;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;middle-east-news;middle-east-full-coverage", "description": "Tiny Israeli drugmaker Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday said its experimental oral insulin succeeded in significantly reducing night-time blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes, according to initial data from a midstage trial.", "Author": "Bill Berkrot", "keywords": "Nadav Kidron,US,ORAMED,INSULIN,Israel,Company News,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),Europe,Middle East,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Diabetes,United States", "news_keywords": "Nadav Kidron;US;ORAMED;INSULIN;Israel;Company News;Health / Medicine;Western Europe;Corporate Events;Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC);Europe;Middle East;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Diabetes;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed May 18 11:37:39 UTC 2016", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2016-05-18T11:37:39+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Bill Berkrot", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oramed-insulin-idUSKCN0Y91F2", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Oramed says oral insulin succeeds in midstage type 2 diabetes trial", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Nadav Kidron,US,ORAMED,INSULIN,Israel,Company News,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),Europe,Middle East,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Diabetes,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-ORAMED-INSULIN", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Slideshow", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Oramed says oral insulin succeeds in midstage type 2 diabetes trial", "sailthru.author": "Bill Berkrot", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-18T11:37:39+0000", "sailthru.title": "Oramed says oral insulin succeeds in midstage type 2 diabetes trial", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Oramed says oral insulin succeeds in midstage type 2 diabetes trial", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oramed-insulin-idUSKCN0Y91F2", "type": "article", "description": "Tiny Israeli drugmaker Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday said its experime...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160518&t=2&i=1137742518&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEC4H0QZ", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-18T11:37:39+0000", "modified_time": "2016-05-18T11:37:39+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Bill Berkrot", "tag": "Nadav Kidron,US,ORAMED,INSULIN,Israel,Company News,Health / Medicine,Western Europe,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),Europe,Middle East,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Diabetes,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oramed says oral insulin succeeds in midstage type 2 diabetes trial", "description": "Tiny Israeli drugmaker Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday said its experimental oral insulin succeeded in significantly reducing night-time blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes, accordi...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160518&t=2&i=1137742518&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEC4H0QZ", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20160518&t=2&i=1137742518&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEC4H0QZ"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tentpoles/AdvancingForward/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
