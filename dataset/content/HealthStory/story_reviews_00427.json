Specialists now have a way to test the parents-to-be that may not only increase their chances of getting pregnant but also reduce the risk of them passing on certain genetic diseases.\n\n\u201cWhen we do pre-implantation genetic screening, we can ensure that the embryos are chromosomally normal before transferring them back to the intended mother\u2019s uterus, and that increases the likelihood of implantation,\u201d Dr. Jared Robbins, an associated professor in obstetrics and gynecology-reproductive endo & infertility at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told Fox News.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), birth defects caused by genetic disorders affect one in every 33 births in the United States.\n\nThe test results may limit the chances of an embryo carrying a chromosomal disorder from being implanted.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fix the embryos yet, but we can determine which embryos are affected by the disease and which aren\u2019t and only transfer back those that are not affected,\u201d Robbins, who is also a fertility doctor at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said.\n\nA diagnosis before pregnancy may sound like a designer baby, but doctors say that\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cWe have the technology and ability to eradicate diseases that have ravaged families for decades,\u201d Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, of Texas Fertility Center, told Fox News. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost family members generation after generation after generation, or they\u2019ve had family members who\u2019ve suffered from chronic disease that\u2019s totally preventable.\u201d\n\nThese procedures not only help limit the passing on of diseases\u2014 they may also help couples get pregnant faster.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting significantly higher pregnancy rates, significantly lower miscarriage rates,\u201d Silverberg said.\n\nThese results have helped eliminate pre-term birth and hospitalizations for pre-term labor, and patients and families have better outcomes, he added.\n\nPre-implantation genetic screening doesn\u2019t necessarily get patients pregnant unless they have good embryos, Robbins noted.\n\n\u201cAll it does is allow us to choose the best embryos to transfer so that we can get the patients pregnant faster,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts say the couples are not the only people who benefit from these tests. The results may help family members who are trying to get pregnant make decisions as well.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/04/28/640/360/931/524/042816_health_birthdefects_1280.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/meningitis_split.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/lollipop-ban-da-437275.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/life_support_istock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/steamer-horror-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/04/28/640/360/042816_health_birthdefects_1280.jpg"], "top_img": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/04/28/640/360/042816_health_birthdefects_1280.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/embryo-screening-helps-couples-avoid-genetic-diseases", "title": "Embryo screening helps couples avoid genetic diseases", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "For 6.7 million American women of child-bearing age, getting pregnant is not an easy task.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "health", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Embryo screening helps couples avoid genetic diseases", "dcterms.abstract": "For 6.7 million American women of child-bearing age, getting pregnant is not an easy task.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "For 6.7 million American women of child-bearing age, getting pregnant is not an easy task.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:03890af9-2a76-54a9-ba89-6c5e3efb3527", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2016-05-25", "dcterms.created": "2016-05-25T12:41:57-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-25T12:48:39-04:00", "og": {"title": "Embryo screening helps couples avoid genetic diseases", "description": "For 6.7 million American women of child-bearing age, getting pregnant is not an easy task.", "type": "article", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/04/28/640/360/042816_health_birthdefects_1280.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/embryo-screening-helps-couples-avoid-genetic-diseases", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Embryo screening helps couples avoid genetic diseases", "description": "For 6.7 million American women of child-bearing age, getting pregnant is not an easy task.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/04/28/640/360/1024/512/042816_health_birthdefects_1280.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/health/embryo-screening-helps-couples-avoid-genetic-diseases"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH/Infertility,/FOX NEWS/HEALTH", "classification-isa": "infertility,health"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1464235200.0, "source": "http://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
