We\u2019re controlling the dosage and we\u2019re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.\u201d\n\nThe patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off.\n\nAlthough TEPI patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin, it is not uncomfortable to peel off, unlike many traditional plasters.\n\nAccording to Andrew Lee, co-founder of Medherant, \u201cwe\u2019ve only been in the lab about 12 months, but in the 12 months we\u2019ve essentially assessed about 90 percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches. We\u2019ve tested them in our polymers with very good results, we\u2019ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we\u2019ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well.\u201d\n\nThe team says TEPI patches could go on sale within three years, and Medherant is working with some large, unnamed, pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market.\n\nHaddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we\u2019re limited to about 20 different drugs, and there are thousands of drugs out there, and only about 20 are used in patches at the moment, which is limited by the technology of the adhesive, essentially,\u201d he said.\n\nLee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant\u2019s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.\n\n\u201cOne of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven\u2019t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,\u201d said Lee.\n\nThe TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik. Lee believes ibuprofen strips could be useful for sports participants, helping alleviate conditions such as tendonitis, and repetitive strain injuries. Nutrition companies have also shown an interest in adapting Medherant\u2019s technology for transmitting minerals and vitamins through the skin.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jim Drury", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibuprofen-skinpatch-idUSKCN0VV1P2", "title": "Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "An ibuprofen patch that delivers the painkiller directly through the skin to the site of pain, at a consistent dose for up to 24 hours, has been developed by UK researchers.", "Author": "Jim Drury", "keywords": "Andrew Lee,DAVID HADDLETON,US,IBUPROFEN,SKINPATCH,Science", "news_keywords": "Andrew Lee;DAVID HADDLETON;US;IBUPROFEN;SKINPATCH;Science", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Feb 22 16:01:40 UTC 2016", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2016-02-22T16:01:40+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Jim Drury", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibuprofen-skinpatch-idUSKCN0VV1P2", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Andrew Lee,DAVID HADDLETON,US,IBUPROFEN,SKINPATCH,Science", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-IBUPROFEN-SKINPATCH", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Video", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future", "sailthru.author": "Jim Drury", "sailthru.date": "2016-02-22T16:01:40+0000", "sailthru.title": "Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibuprofen-skinpatch-idUSKCN0VV1P2", "type": "article", "description": "An ibuprofen patch that delivers the painkiller directly through the skin to the...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-22T16:01:40+0000", "modified_time": "2016-02-22T16:01:40+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Jim Drury", "tag": "Andrew Lee,DAVID HADDLETON,US,IBUPROFEN,SKINPATCH,Science"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future", "description": "An ibuprofen patch that delivers the painkiller directly through the skin to the site of pain, at a consistent dose for up to 24 hours, has been developed by UK researchers.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1456156900.0, "source": "http://www.reuters.com", "summary": ""}
