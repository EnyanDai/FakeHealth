These tumors were those that had returned following an initial surgical removal and follow-up treatment with procedures such as chemotherapy or radiation.\n\nSurvival rates using cryoablation were about 60 months, which is comparable to the survival rates for women whose tumors do not return after the first surgical procedure. However, about 80 percent of women who first treat their tumors with surgery do eventually experience a recurrence, according to Hyun J. Bang, MD, a radiology resident at Wayne State University.\n\nOvarian cancer is the deadliest of cancers that affect the female reproductive system, with about 22,000 women diagnosed each year and, in 2011, approximately 15,460 deaths. \"Unfortunately, this cancer produces few, if any, symptoms in early stages,\" said Bang. \"This is why 75 percent of all women present with advanced disease which has already begun to spread to other areas of the body.\"\n\nThe team treated 48 tumors, including those on the soft tissue, liver and lungs, in 21 women. In this study, cryoablation allowed nearly all women \u2013 98 percent in the study \u2014to eliminate their tumors without returning. In comparison, treating initial tumors with surgery and therapies such as chemo has only resulted in a 43 percent success rate, historically, Bang said.\n\nCryoablation of many tumors may be considered a treatment alternative, especially for those with anesthesia risks, painful lesions or those who want local control during chemotherapy, the researchers concluded.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/_inside2011/_i/_share/email.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/_inside2011/_i/_share/print.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/thumbs-squares/kimpainter.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/thumbs-squares/lemke.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/yourlife/_common/global/images/twitter_icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/thumbs-squares/hollycorbettbristol.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/communitymanager/_photos/healthy-POV/2012/02/08/ovarian_CA020812x-inset-community.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/thumbs-squares/cheryl_alkon.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/yourlife/_photos/2011/08/31/hospitalmanual.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/yourlife/_common/global/images/face_b_icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/yourlife/_common/global/images/gannett_logo_footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/_inside2011/_i/_share/plus.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120211001513im_/http://i.usatoday.net/communitymanager/_photos/healthy-POV/2012/02/08/ovarian_CA020812x-inset-community.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cheryl Alkon"], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Healthy Perspective: The latest health & wellness news with a dose of conversation", "meta_data": {"description": "The latest health and wellness news with a dose of conversation", "keywords": "USA TODAY"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
