REUTERS/NIH/Handout\n\nPatients who had taken the drugs to control diabetes were much less likely to have lung cancer spread \u2014 which is when it becomes most deadly \u2014 the researchers told a meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians.\n\nMetformin, an older and cheaper drug available generically, had a more powerful effect than newer drugs called thiazolidinediones, TZDs or glitazones, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cOur study, as well as other research, suggests an association between metformin and/or TZD use and the risk of developing lung cancer,\u201d said Dr. Peter Mazzone of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who led the study.\n\n\u201cHowever, unique to this study, we have been able to report less advanced cancer in those who do develop cancer, a decreased frequency of squamous cell and small cell carcinomas, and improved survival, when controlled for stage, in people taking metformin and/or TZDs.\u201d\n\nThe team reviewed the medical records of 157 lung cancer survivors with diabetes.\n\nThose who had taken either a metformin drug or a TZD were significantly less likely to have advanced lung cancer that had spread \u2014 20 percent of those who took the drugs had tumors that had spread, versus 42 percent of those who had not.\n\n\u201cThe initial trend we have seen is toward metformin being more protective than TZDs,\u201d Mazzone said.\n\nTZDs include GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s Avandia, known generically as rosiglitazone, and rival drug Actos, or pioglitazone, made by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.\n\nMazzone said it may be possible one day to use metformin to prevent lung cancer in smokers.\n\nBut Dr. David Gutterman, president of the American College of Chest Physicians, said more research would be needed before this could be proposed.\n\n\u201cThis new information adds to the growing body of evidence that metformin may help prevent and inhibit the progression of lung cancer,\u201d Gutterman said.\n\nMetformin is one of the most widely used drugs for type 2 diabetes, with 41 million prescriptions written in the United States in 2008, the American College of Chest Physicians said in a statement.\n\nIn May, researchers reported an inhaled drug called iloprost, approved to treat pulmonary hypertension might also prevent lung cancer.\n\nIn April, researchers said a natural supplement derived from food, called myo-inositol, seems to stop the precancerous changes that lead to lung cancer.\n\nLung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer globally, killing 1.2 million people a year. Only 15 percent of people diagnosed with lung cancer are still alive five years later, in part because the disease usually spreads silently for years before it causes clear enough symptoms to be detected.\n\nEarly stage lung tumors can often be removed surgically, however.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates 171 million people globally had diabetes in 2000 and predicts that number will nearly double by 2030 to 366 million.", "images": ["http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101102&t=2&i=239748866&r=2010-11-02T122732Z_01_BTRE6A10YLZ00_RTROPTP_0_US-CANCER-LUNG-DIABETES&w=20", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101102&t=2&i=239748866&w=1200&r=2010-11-02T122732Z_01_BTRE6A10YLZ00_RTROPTP_0_US-CANCER-LUNG-DIABETES"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101102&t=2&i=239748866&w=1200&r=2010-11-02T122732Z_01_BTRE6A10YLZ00_RTROPTP_0_US-CANCER-LUNG-DIABETES", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-lung-diabetes-idUSTRE6A10ID20101102", "title": "Diabetes drugs may help control lung cancer: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Commonly used diabetes drugs such as metformin may help control lung cancer, and may help prevent it, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,CANCER,LUNG,DIABETES", "news_keywords": "US;CANCER;LUNG;DIABETES", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Nov 02 12:27:35 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-11-02T12:27:35+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-lung-diabetes-idUSTRE6A10ID20101102", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Diabetes drugs may help control lung cancer: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,CANCER,LUNG,DIABETES", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-LUNG-DIABETES", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Diabetes drugs may help control lung cancer: study", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2010-11-02T12:27:35+0000", "sailthru.title": "Diabetes drugs may help control lung cancer: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Diabetes drugs may help control lung cancer: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-lung-diabetes-idUSTRE6A10ID20101102", "type": "article", "description": "Commonly used diabetes drugs such as metformin may help control lung cancer, and...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101102&t=2&i=239748866&w=1200&r=2010-11-02T122732Z_01_BTRE6A10YLZ00_RTROPTP_0_US-CANCER-LUNG-DIABETES", "article": {"published_time": "2010-11-02T12:27:35+0000", "modified_time": "2010-11-02T12:27:35+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,CANCER,LUNG,DIABETES"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Diabetes drugs may help control lung cancer: study", "description": "Commonly used diabetes drugs such as metformin may help control lung cancer, and may help prevent it, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101102&t=2&i=239748866&w=1200&r=2010-11-02T122732Z_01_BTRE6A10YLZ00_RTROPTP_0_US-CANCER-LUNG-DIABETES", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101102&t=2&i=239748866&w=1200&r=2010-11-02T122732Z_01_BTRE6A10YLZ00_RTROPTP_0_US-CANCER-LUNG-DIABETES"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1288700855.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
