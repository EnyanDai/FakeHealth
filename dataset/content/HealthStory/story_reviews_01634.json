Antidepressant medications are one treatment option, but there are safety concerns.\n\nOne recent study, for example, found that pregnant women who started taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the second or third trimester had a higher risk of preterm delivery than other women. SSRIs include drugs like sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine\n\n(Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac).\n\nBecause of the potential for harm from medications, many pregnant women with depression may prefer psychotherapy or other non-drug options.\n\nAcupuncture has been used for more than 2,000 years in Chinese medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments. According to traditional medicine, specific acupuncture points on the skin are connected to internal pathways that conduct energy, or qi (\u201cchee\u201d), and stimulating these points with a fine needle promotes the healthy flow of qi.\n\nModern research has most often focused on the effects of acupuncture on painful conditions, like chronic back pain and migraines. Researchers speculate that it may help ease pain by altering signals among nerve cells or affecting the release of various chemicals of the central nervous system.\n\nIt is unclear, Manber said, why acupuncture might help lessen the severity of depression.\n\nFor their study, she and her colleagues randomly assigned 52 women to receive depression-specific acupuncture twice a week for four weeks, then weekly for another four weeks. Another 49 women received control acupuncture and 49 received massage. All completed a standard measure of depression severity at the outset and again after four and eight weeks of treatment.\n\nAfter eight weeks, patients in the depression-specific acupuncture group had a higher rate of response to treatment. They were not, however, more likely to see a complete remission in their depression; about 35 percent had a remission, versus 29.5 percent in the other two groups combined - a statistically insignificant difference.\n\nFourteen women who received depression-specific acupuncture reported pain during the needling, as did seven in the control-acupuncture group.\n\nOverall, Manber\u2019s team notes, the response to acupuncture in this study was comparable to what has been seen in studies of psychotherapy for depression during pregnancy.\n\nSOURCE: Obstetrics & Gynecology, March 2010.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Norton", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acupuncture-pregnancy-idUSTRE61L5JB20100222", "title": "Acupuncture shows promise for depression in pregnancy", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - For pregnant women with depression, a couple months of acupuncture might help reduce the severity of their symptoms, a small study hints.", "Author": "Amy Norton", "keywords": "Amy Norton,Rachel Manber,US,ACUPUNCTURE,PREGNANCY", "news_keywords": "Amy Norton;Rachel Manber;US;ACUPUNCTURE;PREGNANCY", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Feb 22 22:22:49 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-02-22T22:22:49+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Amy Norton", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acupuncture-pregnancy-idUSTRE61L5JB20100222", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Acupuncture shows promise for depression in pregnancy", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Amy Norton,Rachel Manber,US,ACUPUNCTURE,PREGNANCY", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-ACUPUNCTURE-PREGNANCY", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Acupuncture shows promise for depression in pregnancy", "sailthru.author": "Amy Norton", "sailthru.date": "2010-02-22T22:22:49+0000", "sailthru.title": "Acupuncture shows promise for depression in pregnancy", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Acupuncture shows promise for depression in pregnancy", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acupuncture-pregnancy-idUSTRE61L5JB20100222", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - For pregnant women with depression, a couple months of acupun...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-02-22T22:22:49+0000", "modified_time": "2010-02-22T22:22:49+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Amy Norton", "tag": "Amy Norton,Rachel Manber,US,ACUPUNCTURE,PREGNANCY"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Acupuncture shows promise for depression in pregnancy", "description": "(Reuters Health) - For pregnant women with depression, a couple months of acupuncture might help reduce the severity of their symptoms, a small study hints.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1266877369.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
