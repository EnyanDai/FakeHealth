Seres, the director of medical nutrition at Columbia Medical Center, cautioned that consumers should consult their doctors before trying such products.\n\n\u201cThe promoters of these are appealing to people who think it\u2019s better to do things outside of the medical establishment,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe desire to help people is an extremely strong motivator, but so is money.\u201d He pointed to a section of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Web site that lists several drugs, including sedatives like clonazepam and birth control pills, whose efficacy might be altered by melatonin.\n\n\u201cA hangover effect has been reported\u201d with large doses, said Anna Rouse Dulaney, a toxicologist with the Carolinas Poison Center. But she added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go on the record saying this drug \u2018can\u2019 cause respiratory issues, that should be a \u2018may.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLazy Cakes appear harmless, even amusing, with swirly purple packaging; Kush Cakes have a tie-dye-printed wrapper. But they are not to be underestimated.\n\nOf melatonin, Dr. Seres warned, \u201cIf you take it while you\u2019re driving a car, you will find yourself in a ditch.\u201d\n\nMaybe. Dr. Alfred J. Lewy, a professor of psychiatry at Oregon Health and Science University who has studied melatonin, a neurohormone, estimated that only a third of the population is susceptible to its effects in a supplement.\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd yet Tracy Evans, who owns a bar where musicians perform in Erie, Pa., that has sold hundreds of Lazy Cakes, said she instructs employees to tell partygoers, \u201cI highly recommend you wait to where you\u2019re going to be at the end of the night before eating.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy? \u201cIt knocks you out \u2014 in a good way, not a bad way,\u201d said Ms. Evans, 34. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not to chill. For me, it\u2019s to get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d\n\nYet the products, intended for adults only, are being marketed as a novel way to relax in a stressed-out, wired world. Labels on Lazy Cakes and Mary J\u2019s brownies that were bought online urge users to \u201cTake \u00bd brownie, two times a day.\u201d With tiny type, the labels warn against operating heavy machinery or driving.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Stephanie Yao, a spokeswoman at the F.D.A., wrote in an e-mail that any item that uses melatonin \u201cas an additive may be subject to regulatory action.\u201d\n\nThat is why the makers of these new baked goods label them \u201cNot for food use.\u201d They want them to be considered dietary supplements, which do not need the F.D.A.\u2019s premarket approval and are not required to be proved safe or effective.\n\n\u201cIt sounds to me like they are trying to claim that the entire brownie is like a tablet, which is, of course, preposterous,\u201d Dr. Czeisler said.\n\nTim Barham, the vice president of HBB, the maker of Lazy Cakes, said, \u201cWe look at the brownie as a supplement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNews reports have classified Lazy Cakes as dietary supplements, but last month, Douglas Karas, an F.D.A. spokesman, said in an e-mail that the agency \u201chas not made a determination on Lazy Cakes\u2019 status as either a food or a dietary supplement.\u201d\n\nIn January last year, the F.D.A. sent a warning letter to Peter Bianchi, the creator of Drank, a purple drink with 2 milligrams of melatonin in each can that went on the market in 2008, spawning several competitors.\n\nThe letter cited safety concerns about melatonin in food, specifically research indicating that melatonin reduced glucose tolerance for people with Type 1 diabetes and that some men using it had reported enlarged breasts. It also warned that women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should avoid melatonin \u201cbased on possible hormonal effects.\u201d (Drank\u2019s bottle now say it is a dietary supplement.)\n\nDr. Lewy dismissed the idea that harm might lurk in a melatonin-laced brownie. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have any documented side effects except for making you sleepy at bedtime, which is good,\u201d he said. That said, he would not advise eating Lazy Cakes, partly because he was not sure that their other purportedly sleep-inducing ingredients like valerian root work and partly because food delays rather than hastens the absorption of melatonin.\n\nAlso, Dr. Lewy said, \u201cI don\u2019t need the calories.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/15/us/LAZYCAKES-2/LAZYCAKES-2-popup.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/15/us/LAZYCAKES-1/LAZYCAKES-1-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/15/us/LAZYCAKES-2/LAZYCAKES-2-thumbStandard-v3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/15/us/LAZYCAKES-2/LAZYCAKES-2-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catherine Saint Louis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/us/15lazycakes.html", "title": "Melatonin Makes a Comeback, Leaving Experts Unrelaxed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069741509", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/us/15lazycakes.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/us/15lazycakes.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069741509"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/us/15lazycakes.html", "title": "Melatonin Makes a Comeback, Leaving Experts Unrelaxed", "description": "Dietary supplements promoted as reducing stress and insomnia are easy to buy, but some doctors warn of their harmful effects.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "cslwrites"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Dessert, Laid-Back and Legal", "description": "Dietary supplements promoted as reducing stress and insomnia are easy to buy, but some doctors warn of their harmful effects.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1248069741509, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Melatonin Makes a Comeback, Leaving Experts Unrelaxed", "pdate": 20110514, "utime": 20140908111614, "ptime": 20110514183326, "DISPLAYDATE": "May 14, 2011", "dat": "May 14, 2011", "lp": "Dietary supplements promoted as reducing stress and insomnia are easy to buy, but some doctors warn of their harmful effects.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "15lazycakes", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "published": "2011-05-14T18:33:26-04:00", "modified": "2014-09-08T11:16:14-04:00", "section": "U.S.", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "top-level-section": "us", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/catherine-saint-louis", "tag": "Medicine and Health"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/us/15lazycakes.html", "type": "article", "title": "Melatonin Makes a Comeback, Leaving Experts Unrelaxed", "description": "Dietary supplements promoted as reducing stress and insomnia are easy to buy, but some doctors warn of their harmful effects.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/15/us/LAZYCAKES-2/LAZYCAKES-2-thumbStandard-v3.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Catherine Saint Louis", "tone": "news", "byl": "By CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS", "PT": "article", "CG": "us", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Medicine and Health", "org": "Food and Drug Administration", "keywords": "Melatonin (Hormone),Dietary Supplements and Herbal Remedies,Food and Drug Administration,Medicine and Health", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/15/us/LAZYCAKES-2/LAZYCAKES-2-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1305432000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
