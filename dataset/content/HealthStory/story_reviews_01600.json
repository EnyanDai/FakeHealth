The hospital was one of 117 medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial between 2000 and 2008.\n\nThe 2,500 participants were used to compare carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure to clear blocked blood flow, to carotid artery stenting, a newer and less invasive procedure that involves threading a stent and expanding a small protective device in the artery to widen the blocked area and capture any dislodged plaque. The trial compared the safety and effectiveness of the two procedures in patients with or without a stroke history.\n\n\"Earlier studies were done for patients who had a high risk for surgery, were over the age of 80 and had previous heart attacks or other high risk factors for strokes,\" said Dr. Harish Shownkeen, an interventional neuroradiologist and co-medical director of the stroke and neurovascular program at Central DuPage Hospital. \"This trial was for lower-risk patients and for patients who had a narrowing of the arteries but had no symptoms for a stroke, but could possibly get a stroke down the line. They were also under the age of 80.\"\n\nShownkeen, one of the studies principal investigators, performed the non-surgical carotic artery stenting procedure on Carbine, a retired pipe fitter, in July 2008. Shownkeen has performed this particular technique since 1995.\n\n\"The stenting procedure is a quick \u2018in and out' procedure,\" Shownkeen said. \"It takes me 15-30 minutes to do, the patient has very mild sedation and is completely awake, and I am talking to and evaluating the patient while I am doing the procedure. And the patient goes home in less than 23 hours. We call it a minimally invasive procedure because there are no cuts done anywhere. I just thread a catheter from the groin to the neck and put the stent in the area that is diseased or narrowed.\"\n\nFor Carbine, a father of four and grandfather of six, taking part in the study was well worth it.\n\n\"I feel great now,\" he said. \"It's made me feel like I'm going to live a lot longer.\"\n\nHe said his recuperation time was short.\n\n\"The day after the procedure, I even went to the store with my daughter. And now, I don't get dizzy and my whole body feels better.\"\n\nShownkeen said the new techniques are remarkable and offer hope to many.\n\n\"Stroke is the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. and the leading cause of disability in the U.S.,\" he said. \"I am glad that Mr. Carbine is doing well.\"\n\n.", "images":
