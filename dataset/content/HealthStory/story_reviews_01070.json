The magnetic stimulation costs up to $10,500 for a six-week regimen of care, is not yet covered by insurance, and may not work for many patients.\n\nThe therapy, which carries a slight risk of seizures, is meant for patients with major treatment-resistant depression who do not respond to at least one medication. Still, the technology has enabled Neuronetics to get funding from Quaker BioVentures, a Philadelphia-based venture capital firm that invests in life-science companies.\n\nQuaker's current $700 million in committed capital is funding innovative treatments across the region.\n\nIn Conshohocken, NuPathe has developed Zelrix, an active, single-use patch for the treatment of migraines as an alternative to oral drugs, which often have severe side effects, said chief executive officer Jane Hollingsworth. The company hopes to start selling the patch in 2012 if it gains FDA approval.\n\nTarsa Therapeutics, which is based in Philadelphia, is marketing an oral dosage of a drug called Calcitonin for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\nNear Neuronetics in Malvern, TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals has been shrinking tumors with proteins, trying to avoid the killing of normal cells that occurs with most cancer treatments.\n\nAnd in Bristol, NB Therapeutics says it believes it has solved the delivery problems for the drug Lamisil, used to treat onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection that affects 35 million people in the United States, CEO Frank McCaney said.\n\nQuaker BioVentures is not the only firm investing here. Polaris Venture Partners and Pfizer, which both back early-stage life-science companies, have funded some of these firms, including TetraLogic and Neuronetics.\n\nPolaris director Kevin Bitterman said the decision to invest $30 million in Neuronetics was based largely on the fact that this was a \"classic example of a team working in groundbreaking technology.\"\n\nQuaker BioVentures founding partner Sherrill Neff said his firm \"saw this as a huge opportunity where we could provide safer and more durable treatment in a market which has millions and millions of patients.\"\n\nThe numbers are certainly significant. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 9 percent of U.S. adults have depression, including 3.4 percent with major depression.\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, John O'Reardon directs the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Program. He also ran a Neuronetics-funded trial that helped the product gain FDA approval in 2008. Penn does not use Neuronetics' unit but does employ the technology, conducting more than 1,500 sessions per year, often on difficult cases. \"We've been pretty satisfied with the results,\" O'Reardon said. \"As a treatment, it has been very effective in major depression, which is where it has FDA approval.\"\n\nMore than 4,000 patients have received NeuroStar treatment since its 2008 debut.\n\nNeuronetics does not report sales figures or profits, and NeuroStar is its only product so far. Still, the company says its U.S. employees have risen from 30 to 130 in the last two years.\n\nNeuroStar TMS Therapy uses the same technology as MRI machines, which have been widely used around the world.\n\nPatients get five sessions a week for four to six weeks, and remain awake during the 37-minute session. The cost varies across the country, but is generally about $350 per session. Most patients undergo 20 to 30 sessions, putting the cost at between $7,000 and $10,500.\n\nPsychiatrists themselves pay $70,000 for the system, and Neuronetics provides training and technical support. So far doctors are offering it in Bryn Mawr, Wayne, Huntingdon Valley, Philadelphia, Newtown Square, and Mount Laurel. A full list is at www.neuronetics.com\n\nThe new treatment is not a panacea. One study found that, of patients who failed to benefit from one antidepressant medication, just one-third responded adequately to a second. TMS produced a similar response rate (as does talk therapy, according to other studies), although the effect was described as greater.\n\nSide effects of the treatment include temporary headaches (which were reported by half the patients in one study) and slight discomfort during the actual treatment (reported by a third).", "images":
