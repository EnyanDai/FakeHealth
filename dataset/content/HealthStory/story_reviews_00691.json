Nothing worked.\u201d\n\nFrustrated with living a life in pain, Jarrett turned to Dr. Halland Chen, a knee specialist in New York City, who offered a new non-surgical treatment known as the iovera system.\n\n\"The iovera works in a very novel fashion. It actually harnesses the power of focus cold therapy,\u201d Chen told FoxNews.com.\n\nThe iovera treatment uses a handheld device with nitrous oxide canisters to freeze short needle probes to negative 126 degrees. Once injected into the skin, the cold therapy kills away targeted sensory nerves around the knee-- which prevents the nerve from sending pain signals.\n\n\"Within 15 to 25 minutes we've frozen away the nerve and the patient will know immediately if they have good results,\" Chen said.\n\nChen says he typically sees people with arthritis or those who have had total knee replacements and still struggle with residual pain. The iovera treatment is cleared by the FDA, and is designed to provide temporary pain relief for up to six months after a single session.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing that makes it very safe is one of the reasons why it doesn\u2019t last forever\u2014 because you\u2019re not permanently damaging or killing off the nerves, [the nerves] do regenerate and grow back over time,\u201d Chen said.\n\nEven though the procedure does not correct or cure a patient\u2019s knee problem, Chen says it allows them to regain function and mobility so they can get through physical therapy and regain strength.\n\nAnd as for the pain you might feel during the treatment, patient Charles Bradshaw, 39, said it didn\u2019t hurt at all.\n\n\u201cNo discomfort at all; it\u2019s easier than getting a tattoo,\u201d Bradshaw, who recently received the iovera treatment, told FoxNews.com.\n\nFor comfort, local anesthesia is applied to the area before treatment.\n\n\"It's been three months since I had the treatment, my knee is fine, [and] it doesn't hurt. And I do so much more--so much more. I go out a lot, I play with my grandkids. Everything that I had trouble doing before, I do it now,\u201d Jarrett said.\n\nMost insurance companies do not cover the procedure, and payment can cost around $1,000 per treatment.\n\nFor more information visit ioverahealth.com.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235305im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/iovera_640.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235305im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/876/493/iovera_640.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235305im_/http://metrics.foxnews.com/b/ss/foxnews/1/H22.1--NS/1423439538947?pageName=noscript:health:front:article&g=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/06/new-treatment-instantly-relieves-knee-pain/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235305im_/http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-801796h&cg=0&cc=1&si=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/06/new-treatment-instantly-relieves-knee-pain/&ts=noscript&rnd=1423439538947", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235305im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9013181&c3=&c4=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/06/new-treatment-instantly-relieves-knee-pain/&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.2&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235305im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/iovera_640.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Carlton"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150208235305/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/02/06/new-treatment-instantly-relieves-knee-pain/", "title": "New treatment instantly relieves knee pain", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "New treatment instantly relieves knee pain", "dc.creator": "Lindsay Carlton", "description": "Many Americans feel hopeless when it comes to chronic knee pain.
