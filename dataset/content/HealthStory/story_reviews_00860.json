Reid, PhD, professor of cardiovascular epidemiology and preventive medicine at Monash University in Australia.\n\nReid and his team constructed a mathematical model to predict the long-term health effects of eating dark chocolate daily in high-risk people. They did not study actual people eating actual chocolate.\n\nThe researchers also computed whether it would be cost-effective to spend money on a public education campaign about dark chocolate's benefits. They found it would be.\n\nSeveral studies have found that dark chocolate, with its heart-healthy flavonols, can lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol.\n\nHowever, Reid believes theirs is the first study to model the long-term effects of eating dark chocolate in reducing cardiovascular risk.\n\nThe study is published in the journal BMJ.", "images":
