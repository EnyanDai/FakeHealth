Sila, MD, the George M. Humphrey II Professor of Neurology and the director of the Stroke & Cerebrovascular Center at the Neurological Institute Case Medical Center of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, says the benefits of diet and lifestyle choices in disease prevention are more important than ever, given the rising costs of health care.\n\nShe agrees with the study authors and editorialist that it is too early to make any recommendations about olive oil intake and stroke risk. She calls the findings \u201cintriguing\u201d but says they \u201cdo not equate a randomized clinical trial and should be used with appropriate caution in making broad recommendations.\u201d\n\nSuzanne Steinbaum, MD, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, says moderate use of olive oil in cooking and on bread may help protect against stroke in people older than 65.\n\n\u201cOlive oil is a healthy fat and it can reduce cholesterol and inflammation, and has been shown to help reduce the incidence of heart disease,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, we see it may reduce stroke risk in people older than 65.\"\n\nKeeping blood pressure controlled, not smoking, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet that is low in salt and rich in fruits and vegetables can also help reduce stroke risk, she says.", "images":
