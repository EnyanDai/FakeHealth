Lipton, MD, tells WebMD.\n\nLipton directs the Montefiore Headache Center at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.\n\n\"There is a lot of unmet medical need out there in the treatment of migraine,\" he says. \"Some people don't tolerate the drug treatments very well and others just want to avoid them.\"", "images":
