However, oral pills cause side effects such as bleeding between periods, mood swings and nausea in women.\n\n\u201cThese results pave the way for Amphora\u2019s disruption of the contraception market as a novel, highly effective, non-hormonal and woman-controlled method that finally answers women\u2019s long-awaited desire to avoid hormones,\u201d Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said.\n\nThe gel works by regulating vaginal pH within the normal range of 3.5 to 4.5, creating a hostile environment for sperm and certain viral and bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAmphora was found to have a 86 percent efficacy rate in avoiding pregnancies and no serious side-effects were observed in the study, which evaluated about 1,400 healthy women belonging to the age group 18-35 years, Evofem said.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell said he expects Amphora, the company\u2019s lead product, to bring in peak sales of $415 million by 2032.\n\nThe company plans to resubmit the marketing application for Amphora in the second quarter next year and if approved, plans to launch the product in January 2020.\n\nEvofem is also testing Amphora as a preventive treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea - two of the world\u2019s most common sexually transmitted infections.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20181217151809im_/https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181217151809im_/https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181217151809/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-evofem-study-idUSKBN1OG17J", "title": "Evofem's birth control gel meets main study goal;
