By targeting particular drivers of the disease, it\u2019s believed the drugs cause fewer side effects than the steroid creams and pills that are the mainstay of treatment today.\n\nSteroids are blunt instruments that broadly suppress the body\u2019s immune and inflammatory responses, doctors say. They carry the risk of long-term side effects, including thinning or weakening the skin, kidney damage and osteoporosis.\n\nThe Facts on Eczema Affects an estimated 7% to 10% of U.S. adults.\n\nSymptoms include dry and itchy patches of skin.\n\nCaused by a mix of genetic and environmental factors that cause hyperactive inflammation response.\n\nRecent advances include identification of molecules that drive the disease in some patients. Source: Jonathan Silverberg, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine\n\n\u201cThe treatments we have now are either not safe or not effective,\u201d says Emma Guttman-Yassky, professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \u201cThe new drugs are more specific and therefore safer and potentially more effective.\u201d\n\nEczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, affects roughly 12% of U.S. children and 7% to 10% of adults, according to some estimates. It is most common in children and often goes away on its own before adolescence. However, many adults also suffer from the disease, including an estimated 1.6 million with severe types that can have negative effects on their emotional and mental health, leading to bouts of depression or thoughts of suicide.\n\nThe exact causes of eczema aren\u2019t fully understood, but most scientists agree that a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors cause the body\u2019s inflammation response to overreact.\n\nIt\u2019s long been thought the immune system plays a role in the disease, but only in the past five to 10 years has evidence emerged about the specific molecules that are most active.\n\nENLARGE Kelly Hayes of Chicago says she has benefited from the new drug dupilumab after years of suffering with eczema.

Elmariah, a dermatologist and researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see a revolution over the next 10 years in the number of treatments available.\u201d\n\nRegeneron\u2019s drug, dupilumab, targets two such molecules and in late-stage studies helped clear or nearly clear serious rashes in up to 38% of patients, or four times as many as patients taking placebo.\n\nThe FDA has designated dupilumab a \u201cbreakthrough therapy,\u201d which is designed to help speed along promising new drugs to market. Regeneron and its partner, Sanofi, plan to submit dupilumab for FDA approval in the third quarter this year, which means it could be on the market as soon as 2017.\n\nAstraZeneca, AZN -0.23 % Eli Lilly and Roche Holding are some of the other drugmakers studying targeted eczema treatments in clinical studies.\n\nKelly Hayes, a 26-year-old project coordinator at a Chicago software company, has benefited from dupilumab. She has suffered for most of her life from eczema outbreaks that would nearly cover her body in rashes, open lesions and deep cuts. She spent hours each day caring for her skin, including nightly baths with salt, oatmeal and even small amounts of bleach to prevent staph infections.\n\nENLARGE Ms. Hayes\u2019s cleared-up hand after dupilumab treatment. Photo: Alexandar Arsenijevic\n\nMs. Hayes says she often felt shunned by peers growing up because of her appearance. Some schoolmates feared her rashes were contagious and would refuse to have direct contact, she says. For a time, eczema \u201cdestroyed my self-esteem,\u201d she says.\n\nLast year, Ms. Hayes entered a clinical study of Regeneron\u2019s dupilumab. Within six months, her disease had gone from severe to moderate. Her skin became less red, she itched less and she had fewer rashes. Now, after a year and a half, her skin is almost entirely clear of the disease, Ms. Hayes says.\n\n\u201cEmotionally, I feel awesome,\u201d Ms. Hayes says. \u201cIt\u2019s a big boost in confidence knowing that people aren\u2019t going to freak out when they see you.\u201d\n\nAnacor\u2019s drug, called crisaborole, is an ointment aimed at treating children and adults with milder eczema. The drug works by blocking an enzyme known as PDE-4, which has long been known to cause inflammation. However, the only drugs that block the enzyme are pills that carry side effects including nausea and diarrhea and are considered too harsh for patients with mild disease.\n\nAnacor developed a treatment that can be applied directly to the skin and, because it doesn\u2019t circulate throughout the body, avoids causing those serious side effects. It uses the element boron, which allows topical skin medications to better penetrate the skin and hit specific molecular targets like PDE-4, the company says.\n\nIn late-stage studies, roughly half of patients taking crisaborole had their diseases cleared or nearly cleared, a statistically significant improvement compared with 30% to 41% of patients using moisturizing placebos. The most common side effect was pain where the ointment was applied, experienced by about 4.4% of crisaborole patients and 1.2% of control-group patients.\n\nThe FDA is scheduled to decide whether to approve the drug by January. If approved, crisaborole would be the first new nonsteroidal treatment for eczema in more than a decade. Many doctors say they expect the drug to benefit patients whose diseases go undertreated because their fears about steroids cause them to use the drugs less frequently than prescribed.\n\n\u201cWe need a lot more nonsteroidal options, and [crisaborole] looks like it may be an important addition to our armamentarium,\u201d says Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. \u201cWe have limited options for the thing we can safely give patients without worries about their long term use.\u201d\n\nWrite to Joseph Walker at Joseph.Walker@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nEmma Guttman-Yassky\u200b is\u200b a \u200bprofessor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
