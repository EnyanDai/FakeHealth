Depression affects about 20 percent of people at some point in their lives.\n\nThe World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020, depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world.\n\nZhang said his group may consider moving into another trial using only electroacupuncture on patients suffering milder depression.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tan Ee Lyn", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acupuncture-hongkong-depression-idUSBRE82S0FN20120329", "title": "Electroacupuncture may be effective for depression: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "future-of-healthcare;medical-research;technology-upclose;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "Boosting the effect of acupuncture needles with small electric currents may be effective in treating depression, a study in Hong Kong has found.", "Author": "Tan Ee Lyn", "keywords": "Roger Ng,Zhang Zhang,jin,US,ACUPUNCTURE,HONGKONG,DEPRESSION,Hong Kong,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),China (PRC),Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),European Union,Technology (TRBC),Drug Retailers (TRBC),Asia / Pacific,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Pharmaceuticals (Japanese),United States", "news_keywords": "Roger Ng;Zhang Zhang;jin;US;ACUPUNCTURE;HONGKONG;DEPRESSION;Hong Kong;Health / Medicine;Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy);China (PRC);Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);European Union;Technology (TRBC);Drug Retailers (TRBC);Asia / Pacific;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Pharmaceuticals (Japanese);United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Mar 29 10:32:30 UTC 2012", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2012-03-29T10:32:30+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Tan Ee Lyn", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acupuncture-hongkong-depression-idUSBRE82S0FN20120329", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Electroacupuncture may be effective for depression: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Roger Ng,Zhang Zhang,jin,US,ACUPUNCTURE,HONGKONG,DEPRESSION,Hong Kong,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),China (PRC),Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),European Union,Technology (TRBC),Drug Retailers (TRBC),Asia / Pacific,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Pharmaceuticals (Japanese),United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-ACUPUNCTURE-HONGKONG-DEPRESSION", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Electroacupuncture may be effective for depression: study", "sailthru.author": "Tan Ee Lyn", "sailthru.date": "2012-03-29T10:32:30+0000", "sailthru.title": "Electroacupuncture may be effective for depression: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Electroacupuncture may be effective for depression: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-acupuncture-hongkong-depression-idUSBRE82S0FN20120329", "type": "article", "description": "Boosting the effect of acupuncture needles with small electric currents may be e...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2012-03-29T10:32:30+0000", "modified_time": "2012-03-29T10:32:30+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Tan Ee Lyn", "tag": "Roger Ng,Zhang Zhang,jin,US,ACUPUNCTURE,HONGKONG,DEPRESSION,Hong Kong,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),China (PRC),Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),European Union,Technology (TRBC),Drug Retailers (TRBC),Asia / Pacific,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Pharmaceuticals (Japanese),United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Electroacupuncture may be effective for depression: study", "description": "Boosting the effect of acupuncture needles with small electric currents may be effective in treating depression, a study in Hong Kong has found.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tentpoles/AdvancingForward/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
