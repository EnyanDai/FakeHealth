Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary because it has not been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Cancer Society has more on lymphoma.", "images": ["https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/15187.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/15187.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Preidt"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/lymphoma-cancer-news-101/get-active-beat-lymphoma-729290.html", "title": "Get Active, Beat Lymphoma?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "Physical activity appears to help people with lymphoma survive their disease.", "og": {"title": "Get Active, Beat Lymphoma?", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/15187.jpg", "description": "Physical activity appears to help people with lymphoma survive their disease.", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/cancer-information-5/lymphoma-cancer-news-101/get-active-beat-lymphoma-729290.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://consumer.healthday.com", "summary": ""}
