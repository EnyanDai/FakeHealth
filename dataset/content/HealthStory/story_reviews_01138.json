These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia.\n\nStatins such as Lipitor, Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin are widely prescribed to lower so-called \u201cbad\u201d or LDL cholesterol \u2014 a risk factor for heart disease \u2014 and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSeparate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body\u2019s immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday\u2019s study.\n\n\u201cStatins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,\u201d said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research.\n\n\u201cGiven the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.\u201d\n\nDouglas\u2019s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors\u2019 practices in Britain to identify statin users.\n\nThey then matched each statin user \u2014 who was aged over 40 when first prescribed a statin between 1995 and 2006 \u2014 with up to five non-statin users for comparison.\n\nPatients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.\n\nDouglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png",
