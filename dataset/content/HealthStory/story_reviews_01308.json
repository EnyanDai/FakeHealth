Smith, a prostate cancer specialist at the Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nAlso, bone scans actually measure bone formation, not the presence of cancer itself. So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. However, Dr. Smith said he doubted that was the case because there were signs the drug also controlled tumors outside the bones.\n\nDrugs now used to treat advanced prostate cancer, like Taxotere, do not have much affect on bone scans, Dr. Smith said. Bone drugs like Zometa from Novartis and denosumab from Amgen can protect cancerous bones from fractures, but have not been shown to fight the cancer itself.\n\nAnother investigator in the trial, Dr. David C. Smith of the University of Michigan, said he could not believe it when the bone scan of one patient, who previously had widespread cancer in his bones, came back completely clean.\n\n\u201cI thought they had scanned the wrong person,\u201d said Dr. Smith, who is not related to the doctor in Massachusetts. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d\n\nExelixis will now add many prostate cancer patients to the midstage clinical trial from which the results were drawn, said Michael M. Morrissey, the company\u2019s chief executive. A late-stage trial could begin as early as next year, he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nXL184 is believed to block the formation of blood vessels that feed tumors and also inhibits a protein called MET that helps spur tumor growth.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProvenge from Dendreon, by contrast, trains the patient\u2019s immune system to attack the tumor. The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April after a clinical trial showed that those getting the drug had a median survival of about 26 months, four months longer than those in a control group.\n\nSome critics say Medicare would not be doing a review of a drug already approved by the F.D.A. were it not for its high cost.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He realized that reimbursement by regional Medicare contractors was inconsistent, so he decided the agency should have a uniform national policy.\n\nThe Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee, which met in Baltimore, did not discuss the cost of Provenge or make a coverage recommendation. It reviewed the clinical trial data and then rated the strength of the data on a scale of 1 to 5.\n\nThe 10 voting members, mainly doctors and health policy experts, averaged 3.6 on the question of how much confidence they had that there was adequate evidence to conclude that Provenge significantly prolongs survival.\n\nThat is between 3, which is intermediate confidence and 5, which is high confidence. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. Trading in Dendreon shares, halted during regular market hours, rose 6 percent after hours.\n\nHowever, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms. That could give Medicare grounds for denying payment when the drug is used off-label, as cancer drugs often are.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMedicare is scheduled to put a proposed decision out for comment by March 30, with a final decision around the end of June.\n\nProvenge has stirred passions since the F.D.A. initially declined to approve it in 2007. Some Dendreon investors and prostate cancer patients staged protests and advertising campaigns and sued the F.D.A. Two doctors who had spurred investor wrath by voting against the drug\u2019s approval at an advisory committee meeting attended a major cancer conference accompanied by bodyguards.\n\nMedicare\u2019s review has drawn hundreds of comments, mostly in favor of coverage. One criticism of the drug was filed by a law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, on behalf of a client who the law firm said wanted to remain anonymous because of the \u201cpublic vilification of anyone that questions Provenge.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/18/business/Prostate/Prostate-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/18/business/Prostate/Prostate-jumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/18/business/Prostate/Prostate-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/health/18prostate.html", "title": "Prostate Drug From Exelixis Shows Promise", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069343246", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/health/18prostate.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/health/18prostate.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069343246"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/health/18prostate.html", "title": "Prostate Drug From Exelixis Shows Promise", "description": "The treatment XL184 seems to clear up cancer that has spread to the bone.
