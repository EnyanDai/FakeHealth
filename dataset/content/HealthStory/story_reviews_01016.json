But it does suggest that laparoscopy could actually save thousands of dollars for some patients, when all costs \u2014 including physician fees, hospital fees and readmissions \u2014 are considered.\n\n\u201cYou really want to look at the total cost, because that\u2019s what society has to pay,\u201d said Dr. Dmitry Oleynikov, who heads the Center for Advanced Surgical Technology at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha and led the new study.\n\n\u201cOverall, this study shows benefit from laparoscopy on every aspect, including cost,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nAppendix removals are one of the most common surgeries in the U.S., with some 750,000 procedures done every year, Oleynikov added.\n\nWith his colleagues, he looked back at some 40,000 such surgeries done at dozens of academic medical centers in the U.S. \u2014 roughly 14,000 open procedures and 26,000 laparoscopic ones.\n\nFor uncomplicated cases of appendicitis, in which the appendix is still intact, the tabs for the two surgeries came out about the same, at just over $7,800.\n\nPeople who had the laparoscopic procedures also had lower death rates, at 0.07 percent versus 0.17 percent, fewer readmissions and a slightly shorter stay at the hospital.\n\nWhen the appendix had burst, however, the open surgery racked up a considerably higher bill. On average, it cost $17,594, compared to $12,125 for the laparoscopic surgery.\n\nYet again, the patients who had laparoscopy fared much better than those who had conventional surgery.\n\n\u201cIn healthy individuals, the death rate is very (small) for all groups of patients. But when you become sicker, laparoscopy is better,\u201d said Oleynikov. \u201cSubstantial savings could be seen if open surgery is done in a laparoscopic fashion.\u201d\n\nBut he acknowledged that the study has major limitations. First, it looks only at academic medical centers. And second, it\u2019s not a randomized controlled trial, which means the patients being compared could be different in important ways, explaining at least part of the outcomes of the two types of surgery.\n\nIndeed, those who had laparoscopy were younger and usually had less severe disease, which could have biased the results in favor of the minimally invasive procedure.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/oOWUTt Annals of Surgery, online July 29, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-appendix-surgery-idUSTRE77L6QP20110822", "title": "Less-invasive appendix surgery shines in new study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Minimally invasive surgery for a burst appendix appears to be more successful and less costly in the long run than the traditional operation, a new study hints.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "US,APPENDIX,SURGERY", "news_keywords": "US;APPENDIX;SURGERY", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Aug 22 21:16:02 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-08-22T21:16:02+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-appendix-surgery-idUSTRE77L6QP20110822", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Less-invasive appendix surgery shines in new study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,APPENDIX,SURGERY", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-APPENDIX-SURGERY", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Less-invasive appendix surgery shines in new study", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2011-08-22T21:16:02+0000", "sailthru.title": "Less-invasive appendix surgery shines in new study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Less-invasive appendix surgery shines in new study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-appendix-surgery-idUSTRE77L6QP20110822", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Minimally invasive surgery for a burst appendix appears to be...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-08-22T21:16:02+0000", "modified_time": "2011-08-22T21:16:02+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "US,APPENDIX,SURGERY"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Less-invasive appendix surgery shines in new study", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Minimally invasive surgery for a burst appendix appears to be more successful and less costly in the long run than the traditional operation, a new study hints.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1313985600.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
