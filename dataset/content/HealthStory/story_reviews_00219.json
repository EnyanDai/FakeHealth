It\u2019s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet.\n\nBurke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California\u2019s Silicon Valley, where he\u2019s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees.\n\nHe used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn\u2019t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics \u2014 some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers \u2014 said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,\u201d Burke acknowledges. \u201cIt\u2019s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cnootropic\u201d was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cbending.\u201d Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.\n\nBut when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.\n\nPiracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it\u2019s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.\n\nUsing \u2018stacks\u2019\n\nA number of companies now market nootropic \u201cstacks,\u201d or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.\n\nBecause they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.\n\nWhen Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. \u201cIt was as if I was buying coke off the street,\u201d he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.\n\nBut self-experimenters such as Burke often don\u2019t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn\u2019t want to maximize their muscle mass?\u201d asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.\n\nBut while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs \u2014 of any type \u2014 improve thinking or productivity over the long run. \u201cThere\u2019s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,\u201d notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, \u201cit\u2019s a zero-sum game. That\u2019s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you\u2019re probably impairing another system.\u201d\n\nShort-term benefits?\n\nEarly studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics \u2014 so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.\n\nA 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer\u2019s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.\n\nAlthough piracetam has a history of \u201crelatively few side effects,\u201d it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. \u201cWe don\u2019t use it at all and never have.\u201d\n\nAs for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. \u201cPiracetam has been studied for decades,\u201d says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But \u201csome of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they\u2019re selling. Please don\u2019t take it, people!\u201d\n\nFor Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.\n\nBurke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee \u2014 a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil \u2014 has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance \u201cto teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.\u201d\n\nLast spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD \u2014 which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity \u2014 was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a \u201cparty dose\u201d \u2014 enough to give you \u201cthe glow\u201d and enhance your cognitive powers without \u201cthe trip.\u201d\n\nBurke says he definitely got the glow. \u201cThe first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.\u201d\n\nThe effects of fasting\n\nNot all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.\n\nNootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.\n\n\u201cWe stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,\u201d says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company\u2019s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms \u2014 not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.\n\n\u201cFasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,\u201d Lam enthuses. \u201cIt\u2019s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.\u201d\n\nNootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.\n\nResearch on animals has shown that intermittent fasting \u2014 limiting caloric intake at least two days a week \u2014 can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.\n\nMark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence \u2014 so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,\u201d he says.\n\nFasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, \u201cI fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.\u201d The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.\n\nFar easier to take a pill.\n\nLooking for an edge\n\nVinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city\u2019s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.\n\nNgo has experimented with piracetam himself (\u201cThe first time I tried it, I thought, \u2018Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.\u2019 I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful\u201d) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (\u201cYou have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It\u2019s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain\u201d).\n\nBut he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.\n\n\u201cThere is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,\u201d Ngo says. \u201cPeople want to find an edge over their competitor \u2014 that\u2019s how they got their position in the first place. I\u2019m trying to give them a little more wiggle room \u2014 but in a safe way.\u201d\n\nHe says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach. \u201cI don\u2019t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate\u201d for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.\n\nIf, for example, someone decides to go on medication \u2014 be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam \u2014 the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.\n\n\u201cI want to empower them,\u201d Ngo says, but \u201cthere\u2019s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nBrainhacking: The frontier in mental illness treatment\n\nSmart drugs are here.
