Tell them it\u2019s a drug that costs $100 per dose. And if you want to make it even more effective, tell them it costs $1,500 instead.\n\nThat\u2019s what researchers from the University of Cincinnati discovered in an unusual clinical trial. Instead of testing a placebo against an actual drug, they pitted two placebos against each other. The only difference between the two sham treatments was their purported price.\n\nMedical researchers are well aware that the dummy pills used in clinical trials often provide as much relief as the actual drugs being tested. This is what\u2019s known as the placebo effect, and it\u2019s quite common in people with Parkinson\u2019s, a movement disorder that causes tremors, stiffness and balance problems. A 2008 meta-analysis found that placebos used in clinical trials of Parkinson\u2019s treatments improved symptoms by an average of 16%.\n\nThe team from the University of Cincinnati and their colleagues had a hunch that patients would be more responsive to a fake drug they thought was real if it came with a heftier price tag. The higher price would be seen as a signal that the treatment was better, they figured.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo they recruited 12 patients with \u201cmoderately advanced\u201d Parkinson\u2019s and asked them to participate in a clinical trial of a medication described as \u201ca new injectable dopamine agonist.\u201d Patients with Parkinson\u2019s lose the brain cells that produce dopamine, and a drug like this could pick up the slack.\n\nThe study volunteers were told that there were two versions of the experimental drug and that both were believed to work equally well. The main difference, the story went, was the way they were made. As a result, one version cost 15 times more than the other.\n\nIn reality, both placebos were composed of the exact same saline solution. And yet, the patients perceived the expensive version to be more effective than the cheaper one, according to results published Wednesday in the journal Neurology.\n\nBoth of the placebos improved motor function compared with a base line test. But when patients got the $1,500-per-dose placebo, their improvement was 9% greater than when they got the $100-per-dose placebo, the researchers reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another test, 67% of the patients were judged \u201cvery good\u201d or having \u201cmarked improvement\u201d after they took the expensive placebo, compared with 58% of patients after they took the purportedly cheap placebo.\n\nThe researchers also used functional MRI scans to assess the patients\u2019 brain activity and found that the \u201ccheap\u201d placebo prompted more action than the \u201cexpensive\u201d one. To the researchers, this was a sign that the patients expected less from the placebo they believed cost less, so their brains responded by doing more work.\n\n\u201cPatients\u2019 expectations have an important role in the efficacy of medical therapies,\u201d the researchers wrote. Another manifestation of this is the preference many patients have for name-brand drugs instead of their generic counterparts, they added.\n\nPlacebos may be fake, but understanding the placebo effect \u2013 and finding ways to make the most of it \u2013 is a real priority for researchers. To the extent that doctors can use placebos to improve patients\u2019 symptoms, they can use the real drugs less, which may be expensive or toxic.\n\n\u201cPlacebo can be the physician\u2019s friend,\u201d a pair of neurologists wrote an editorial that accompanied the study. \u201cThe outcome of this study \u2026 opens our eyes to another nuance of placebo effect.\u201d\n\nFor medical news that\u2019s the real deal, follow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan and \u201clike\u201d Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/598ebdd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x695+0+0/resize/840x570!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F90%2F548f729cfc3958936ce85435349f%2Fla-sci-sn-expensive-placebos-work-better-20150-001", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b169299/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+79/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F90%2F548f729cfc3958936ce85435349f%2Fla-sci-sn-expensive-placebos-work-better-20150-001", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3afa893/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2Fdd%2F1e02d40e5e8b6b703354371b65f0%2Fimg-53608799-turbine-la-bio-karen-kaplan", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b169299/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+79/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F90%2F548f729cfc3958936ce85435349f%2Fla-sci-sn-expensive-placebos-work-better-20150-001", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Science", "Medicine Editor", "Karen Kaplan Is Science", "Medicine Editor At The Los Angeles Times.
