That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time.\n\nAnd not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said.\n\nWomen typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study.\n\nWomen who took hormones had an average of 24 fewer hot flashes per month, while those who took soy had 12 per month fewer. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.\n\nThe researchers looked at 19 studies on how a treatment, either hormones or soy, compared to a placebo. They compared the average number of hot flashes in 760 women who had treatment with 770 who did not.\n\nThe study was published in Menopause: The Journal of the North American Menopause Society.\n\nSoy hasn\u2019t been studied as much as hormone replacement to treat hot flashes, and doctors don\u2019t know exactly how it works. It\u2019s thought to have similar effects to estrogen on the brain, bones, and blood vessels, Bolanos-Diaz told Reuters Health by email.\n\nSoy supplements also have side effects: Nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the NIH. A month\u2019s supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60.\n\n\u201cFor some women, hormone therapy is the best option, for some soy is best, and for some, it\u2019s just watchful waiting until the hot flashes subside,\u201d Bachmann said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/hBua85 Menopause: The Journal of The North American Menopause Society, online March 3, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hormones-be-better-than-soy-hot-flash-idUSTRE72E7P820110315", "title": "Hormones may be better than soy for hot flashes", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Hormone replacement therapy may work slightly better than soy at reducing menopausal hot flashes, a new study says.", "Author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "keywords": "US,HORMONES,BE,BETTER,THAN,SOY,HOT,FLASHES", "news_keywords": "US;HORMONES;BE;BETTER;THAN;SOY;HOT;FLASHES", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Mar 15 19:21:35 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-03-15T19:21:35+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hormones-be-better-than-soy-hot-flash-idUSTRE72E7P820110315", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Hormones may be better than soy for hot flashes", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,HORMONES,BE,BETTER,THAN,SOY,HOT,FLASHES", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-HORMONES-BE-BETTER-THAN-SOY-HOT-FLASHES", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Hormones may be better than soy for hot flashes", "sailthru.author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "sailthru.date": "2011-03-15T19:21:35+0000", "sailthru.title": "Hormones may be better than soy for hot flashes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Hormones may be better than soy for hot flashes", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hormones-be-better-than-soy-hot-flash-idUSTRE72E7P820110315", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Hormone replacement therapy may work slightly better than soy...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-03-15T19:21:35+0000", "modified_time": "2011-03-15T19:21:35+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Leigh Krietsch Boerner", "tag": "US,HORMONES,BE,BETTER,THAN,SOY,HOT,FLASHES"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Hormones may be better than soy for hot flashes", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Hormone replacement therapy may work slightly better than soy at reducing menopausal hot flashes, a new study says.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1300161600.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
