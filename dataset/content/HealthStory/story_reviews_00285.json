The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInstead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another.\n\n\u201cIt weakens the bacteria so the mouse\u2019s own defenses work better\u201d to clear the infection, she said. The plant extracts didn't harm the skin tissues or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin.\n\nThe discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial-resistant infections, an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high-level United Nations summit last fall.\n\nAD\n\nMRSA has become a serious threat to human health; in 2011, it was responsible for more than 80,000 invasive infections and more than 11,000 deaths in the United States, according to federal statistics.\n\nAD\n\nAntimicrobial resistance refers to infections that have evolved the ability to withstand drugs that ought to stop them. The medicines include antibiotics, which act on bacteria, as well as drugs to fight fungal, viral or parasitic infections. Fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become \u201csuperbugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient,\u201d said Quave.\n\nPlants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries, and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation, which points to their efficacy, she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t save that knowledge over centuries\u201d if something doesn\u2019t work, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to answer the question: Does this work against bacteria, and how does it work, and is it safe to use?\u201d\n\nThe Brazilian peppertree, a shrubby tree native to South America, is an invasive species throughout the southern United States, particularly in Florida, where it\u2019s sometimes called the Florida holly or broad-leaf peppertree, and is considered a noxious weed. The woody plant has long been a staple in Brazilian traditional medicine. Its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds, ulcers, burns and skin infections, Quave said.\n\nLess is known about the plant\u2019s fruit, which was used traditionally as topical poultices for infected wounds and ulcers.\n\nAD\n\nFrom an ecological standpoint, Quave said, it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment.\n\nAD\n\nBut she said the average person shouldn\u2019t try to use the weed to make their own medicine. \u201cNot everything that is natural is safe,\u201d she said.\n\nHer lab at Emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract. Researchers would still need to conduct pre-clinical trials to test its medicinal benefits.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NpTTYaZxJhHKDtIlx0JDmQo_77Y=/90x90/smart/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/a26342b5-8039-48cd-9aa0-2f4871bb7694.png", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LzLMfQxmgPGm6aWwV7TZnn6QTpY=/150x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NQDZ7GZAUA24JJNFQB57XAMO6Q.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M8Go8g6eLIQEKU6G868NNh8yC5c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U72O6QV2FQ3IFILCMJAFLSQHVA.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M8Go8g6eLIQEKU6G868NNh8yC5c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U72O6QV2FQ3IFILCMJAFLSQHVA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lena H.
