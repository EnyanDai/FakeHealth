The associated pain can last months or even years.\n\nAbout a million episodes of shingles, sometimes debilitating, occur in the U.S. annually, Tseng says.\n\nThe new study is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nAnother new study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, finds that by 2008, less than 7% of U.S. adults aged 60 and older had gotten the vaccine, which has been available just since 2006.\n\nCalled Zostavax, the shingles vaccine is made by Merck.", "images":
