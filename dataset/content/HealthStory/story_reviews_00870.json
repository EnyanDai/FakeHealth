He is an associate professor in the department of infection and obesity at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.\n\nOne large egg has about 70 calories, and it contains about 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, and 186 milligrams of cholesterol.\n\nThe research was funded by the American Egg Board, and will be presented at the19th European Congress on Obesity in Lyon, France.", "images":
