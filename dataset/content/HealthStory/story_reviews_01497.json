Implanted in the patient\u2019s chest after the diseased heart is removed, it uses information gleaned from sensors to mimic the activity of the natural organ. It is operated by a microcontroller and powered by electromagnetic induction through the skin or through a plug implanted behind the patient\u2019s ear.\n\nCarmat estimates its device will cost $176,000 to $226,000. When all expenses are considered, including hospital and surgical expenses, it says it will cost just over $315,000, about the same as a transplant.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe device was developed over 15 years by a team that included Alain F. Carpentier, the French surgeon-scientist who, along with Albert Starr, received the 2007 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. The Lasker Foundation, which is based in New York, praised their work in the development of artificial heart valves, saying they had \u201cprolonged and enhanced the lives of millions of people with heart disease.\u201d\n\nIn the November 2009 bulletin of the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine, Dr. Carpentier wrote that, instead of picking up from older models of artificial hearts built on animal research, the developers of the new device had sought to use the tools of the digital revolution, namely computer-assisted design, hemodynamic modeling, regulation algorithms and simulations.\n\nThe French company is not the first to make total artificial hearts, which are meant to completely replace damaged and diseased organs.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

DeVries implanted in a retired dentist named Barney B. Clark in 1982. Its device, powered by a small air compressor that can be carried in a backpack, has been implanted in more than 800 patients as a bridge before transplant.\n\nAbiomed, a company based in Danvers, Mass., makes a self-contained total artificial heart, the electrical-powered AbioCor. The United States Food and Drug Administration has designated the AbioCor as a \u201chumanitarian use device,\u201d meaning its use is restricted to people who are ineligible for transplants and would otherwise be facing imminent death.\n\nOthers are in development. In the United States, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health, is supporting efforts by two separate groups, one led by Dr. O. H. Frazier of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, the other by Dr. Leonard A. R. Golding of the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother device is being developed by scientists at the Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a major need for a permanent, total artificial heart,\u201d Laman A. Gray Jr., the University of Louisville professor of surgery who implanted the first AbioCor heart in 2001, said.\n\nCiting World Health Organization data that shows heart disease is the world\u2019s leading cause of death, Mr. Conviti, the Carmat chief executive, estimated the potential market at \u201ca minimum\u201d of 100,000 patients a year in the United States and Europe. However, he said cost constraints meant it was unlikely that more than one-tenth of those patients would actually receive an artificial heart.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/07/14/business/14Heart2/14Heart2-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/07/14/business/14Heart2/14Heart2-popup.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/07/14/business/14Heart1/14Heart1-articleLarge.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/07/14/business/14Heart2/14Heart2-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Jolly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/global/14heart.html", "title": "French Company Promotes Its Artificial Heart Technology", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1247468438707", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/global/14heart.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/global/14heart.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1247468438707"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/global/14heart.html", "title": "French Company Promotes Its Artificial Heart Technology", "description": "Carmat said it was testing what is known as a total artificial heart, an electronic device with synthetic and human tissue to replace a patient\u2019s heart.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "davjolly"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "An Artificial Heart Its Makers Say Could Be a Standard Replacement", "description": "Carmat said it was testing what is known as a total artificial heart, an electronic device with synthetic and human tissue to replace a patient\u2019s heart.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1247468438707, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "French Company Promotes Its Artificial Heart Technology", "pdate": 20100713, "utime": 20150121232329, "ptime": 20100713175538, "DISPLAYDATE": "July 13, 2010", "dat": "July 13, 2010", "lp": "Carmat said it was testing what is known as a total artificial heart, an electronic device with synthetic and human tissue to replace a patient\u2019s heart.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "14heart", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/global/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-07-13T17:55:38-04:00", "modified": "2015-01-21T23:23:29-05:00", "section": "Global Business", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E", "top-level-section": "business", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-jolly", "tag": "Medicine and Health"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/global/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/global/14heart.html", "type": "article", "title": "French Company Promotes Its Artificial Heart Technology", "description": "Carmat said it was testing what is known as a total artificial heart, an electronic device with synthetic and human tissue to replace a patient\u2019s heart.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/07/14/business/14Heart2/14Heart2-thumbStandard.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "David Jolly", "tone": "news", "byl": "By DAVID JOLLY", "PT": "article", "CG": "business", "SCG": "global", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Medicine and Health", "org": "European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co", "keywords": "Carmat,Heart,Transplants,European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co,Medicine and Health", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/07/14/business/14Heart2/14Heart2-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/global", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1279080000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
