Osteoarthritis, which is usually felt only in the joints, is caused by wear and tear on the body.\n\nFor the study, the investigators analyzed the findings of 40 studies published between January 1990 and December 2011. The studies included arthritis patients aged 18 or older who had hip or knee replacements.\n\nThe findings are published in the Nov. 28 online edition of Arthritis & Rheumatism.\n\n\"Joint arthroplasty is successful in relieving the pain and disability caused by hip or knee arthritis,\" study author Dr. Bheeshma Ravi, from the University of Toronto and Women's College Research Institute, said in a journal news release. \"While complication rates are low, there are some cases with serious consequences that include infection, joint dislocation, blood clots and even death.\"\n\nThe study team found no differences between the two groups of arthritis patients in rates of follow-up surgery, or 90-day blood clot or death risk.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis affects about 1.3 million people in the United States, while osteoarthritis affects 27 million Americans aged 25 and older, according to the American College of Rheumatology.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases has more about hip replacement.", "images": ["http://consumer.healthday.com/images/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "http://consumer.healthday.com/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Preidt"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/bone-and-joint-information-4/osteo-arthritis-news-42/certain-arthritis-patients-fare-worse-after-joint-replacement-study-671000.html", "title": "Certain Arthritis Patients Fare Worse After Joint Replacement: Study", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "Compared to osteoarthritis, those with rheumatoid disease had higher risk of infection, dislocation", "og": {"title": "Certain Arthritis Patients Fare Worse After Joint Replacement: Study", "description": "Compared to osteoarthritis, those with rheumatoid disease had higher risk of infection, dislocation", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/bone-and-joint-information-4/osteo-arthritis-news-42/certain-arthritis-patients-fare-worse-after-joint-replacement-study-671000.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://consumer.healthday.com", "summary": ""}
