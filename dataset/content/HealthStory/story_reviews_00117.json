Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said in a statement. \u201cI really cannot overstate the size of this effect.\u201d\n\nThe key finding is that there is often more time than doctors realized in which brain cells can still be rescued by a procedure to remove the clot. Traditional guidelines have set a limit of six hours after stroke symptoms begin, and said after that it would be too late to help.\n\nThe study showed that the time window could be expanded to 16 hours. However, the findings do not apply to every stroke victim. The researchers used a special type of brain imaging to identify the patients who still had live brain tissue that could be saved if the blood supply was restored. Only about half the patients who were screened qualified for treatment, known as thrombectomy, which uses a mechanical device to pull clots out of a blood vessel.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/science/25STROKE/25STROKE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/science/25STROKE/25STROKE-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/science/25STROKE/25STROKE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Grady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/health/stroke-clots-brain.html", "title": "New Findings Could Save Lives of More Stroke Patients", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-01-24T22:55:53.000Z", "modified": "2018-01-24T17:55:53.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-grady", "tag": "Stanford University", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005700248, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/a8d7b01d-b91d-5c76-91a9-44b42263745a", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/5e7ce4bf394a476f90c69ee1f4cdaf5f", "description": "Doctors have more time than they thought to prevent death and disability from stroke, by removing blood clots that block circulation to the brain, a study shows.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/science/25STROKE/25STROKE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Denise Grady", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/science/25STROKE/25STROKE-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Stroke,Brain,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,The New England Journal of Medicine,Stanford", "pdate": 20180124, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/health/stroke-clots-brain.html", "type": "article", "title": "New Findings Could Save Lives of More Stroke Patients", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/science/25STROKE/25STROKE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "A doctor performing a thrombectomy on a patient with stroke symptoms.
