REUTERS/David Gray\n\nThey said ensuring that pregnant women get this basic prenatal care could have a big effect on the educational futures of children who live in poor communities where iron deficiency is common.\n\n\u201cIron is essential for the development of the central nervous system,\u201d said Parul Christian, an expert in international health at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nIron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world, affecting 2 billion people, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nEarly iron deficiency can interfere with nerve development, biochemistry and metabolism, hampering both intellectual and fine motor development.\n\nChristian\u2019s team studied 676 school-age children whose mothers had been in a clinical trial in which some got iron and folic acid supplements and other nutrients while they were pregnant. About 80 percent of the children \u2014 aged 7 to 9 \u2014 were enrolled in school.\n\n\u201cWe had the opportunity to follow the offspring of women who had participated in a randomized trial of iron and folic acid and other micronutrients to assess neurocognitive function and outcomes,\u201d Christian said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cWhat we showed is prenatal iron and folic acid supplementation had a significant impact on the offspring\u2019s intellectual level and motor ability and ability during school age, which was a very exciting finding,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt had an impact across a range of function, including intellectual function, executive function and fine motor function,\u201d factors that could affect a child\u2019s later academic success, Christian said.\n\nShe said many children in poor communities would benefit from better prenatal programs that include the low-cost nutritional supplements.\n\n\u201cThese results speak to a large swath of people residing in that part of the world. Iron and folic acid deficiency are very common,\u201d she said.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that in developing countries, every other pregnant woman is anemic and about 40 percent of preschool children are anemic.\n\nThe study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101222&t=2&i=283386179&w=1200&r=2010-12-22T145053Z_01_BTRE6BL159G00_RTROPTP_0_US-BRAIN-NUTRIENTS", "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101222&t=2&i=283386179&r=2010-12-22T145053Z_01_BTRE6BL159G00_RTROPTP_0_US-BRAIN-NUTRIENTS&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101222&t=2&i=283386179&w=1200&r=2010-12-22T145053Z_01_BTRE6BL159G00_RTROPTP_0_US-BRAIN-NUTRIENTS", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brain-nutrients-idUSTRE6BK68620101222", "title": "Moms who take folic acid, iron have smarter kids", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Children in rural Nepal whose mothers were given iron and folic acid supplements during pregnancy were smarter, more organized and had better fine motor skills than children whose mothers did not get them, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "Nepal,United States,Eric Walsh,US,BRAIN,NUTRIENTS", "news_keywords": "Nepal;United States;Eric Walsh;US;BRAIN;NUTRIENTS", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Dec 22 14:51:16 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-12-22T14:51:16+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brain-nutrients-idUSTRE6BK68620101222", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Moms who take folic acid, iron have smarter kids", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Nepal,United States,Eric Walsh,US,BRAIN,NUTRIENTS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-BRAIN-NUTRIENTS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Moms who take folic acid, iron have smarter kids", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2010-12-22T14:51:16+0000", "sailthru.title": "Moms who take folic acid, iron have smarter kids", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Moms who take folic acid, iron have smarter kids", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brain-nutrients-idUSTRE6BK68620101222", "type": "article", "description": "Children in rural Nepal whose mothers were given iron and folic acid supplements...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101222&t=2&i=283386179&w=1200&r=2010-12-22T145053Z_01_BTRE6BL159G00_RTROPTP_0_US-BRAIN-NUTRIENTS", "article": {"published_time": "2010-12-22T14:51:16+0000", "modified_time": "2010-12-22T14:51:16+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "Nepal,United States,Eric Walsh,US,BRAIN,NUTRIENTS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Moms who take folic acid, iron have smarter kids", "description": "Children in rural Nepal whose mothers were given iron and folic acid supplements during pregnancy were smarter, more organized and had better fine motor skills than children whose mothers did not get ...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101222&t=2&i=283386179&w=1200&r=2010-12-22T145053Z_01_BTRE6BL159G00_RTROPTP_0_US-BRAIN-NUTRIENTS", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101222&t=2&i=283386179&w=1200&r=2010-12-22T145053Z_01_BTRE6BL159G00_RTROPTP_0_US-BRAIN-NUTRIENTS"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
