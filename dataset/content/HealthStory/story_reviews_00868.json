According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if everyone 50 or older were regularly screened, as many as 60% of deaths could be avoided.\n\nBut Dr. Michael Zalis, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells the Health Blog that many people may avoid this procedure because the preparation, which requires patients to cleanse their colons with a laxative, is so unpleasant. In addition, some patients fear the instrument used in the procedure, or have concerns about the risks from anesthesia or of perforation of the bowel.\n\n\u201cNo one should be dying from colon cancer, which is almost completely preventable with screening; and if it were sufficiently easy more people would do it,\u201d says Zalis, lead author of the study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nIn recent years, the use of computed tomographic colonography\u2014known as CT or \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy\u2014has eliminated the need for the most invasive part of the procedure. But though these virtual scans are performed externally, patients still have to take the laxatives so the scanning machines can read the empty colon.\n\nSo, the researchers developed a software program to electronically \u201ccleanse\u201d the bowel, Zalis says. Prior to a scan, researchers asked patients to adhere to a low-fiber diet for a few days and drink a special fluid to \u201ctag\u201d the colon\u2019s contents. After performing the CT scan, the software electronically identified polyps.\n\nThe researchers screened 605 patients with the laxative-free CT scan and followed up with traditional colonoscopy to find out how successfully the virtual method detected precancerous polyps of six millimeters or more. The laxative-free scan accurately identified 91% of patients with polyps of 10 mm or larger -- those at highest risk of becoming cancerous -- but was less accurate for smaller lesions, the study says.\n\nDr. James Aisenberg, a gastroenterologist and clinical professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, agrees that, for some people, the laxative requirement can be a barrier to colorectal screening.\n\nHowever, like virtual colonoscopy in general, laxative-free CTC \u201cwill miss a subset of precancerous polyps and thus is unlikely to become the gold standard for colorectal-cancer prevention,\u201d says Dr. Aisenberg, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study.\n\nHowever, the laxative-free method \u201cmay become a useful alternative for persons who won't otherwise undergo screening, and is much better than no screening at all.\u201d\n\nDr. Zalis and some of his co-investigators developed the software. The American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health and General Electric Co.\u2019s health-care unit\u2014which markets scanning devices and accessories\u2014supported the researchers. Dr. Zalis says the company had no influence on the study.", "images": ["https://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-SY605_gileny_C_20120514164849.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/S1-EA825_Kessle_C_20191107131242.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/S1-EB122_ROLLOV_C_20191108110115.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/S1-DI378_WATCH_C_20190827142208.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Landro"], "canonical_link": "https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2012/05/14/new-method-easing-preparation-may-encourage-colon-checks/", "title": "New Method Easing Preparation May Encourage Colon Checks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "page.subsection": "Health Blog", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "WSJ", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2012/05/14/new-method-easing-preparation-may-encourage-colon-checks/", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "title": "New Method Easing Preparation May Encourage Colon Checks", "description": "A new method for performing a \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy was shown to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps\u2014and was a better experience for patients."}, "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "testkeys": "C", "dj.asn": "172-2", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.format": "responsive", "cx_shield": "{\"campaign\":99999,\"placement\":\"cx-articlecover\",\"tag\":\"openhouse\",\"type\":\"free\",\"ignorePaywall\":false,\"bucket\":8}", "article.type": "Health Blog", "article.page": "Health Blog Blog", "article.section": "Business", "article.template": "full", "article_template": "full", "article.id": "BL-HEB-49283", "article.access": "free", "article.headline": "New Method Easing Preparation May Encourage Colon Checks", "article.summary": "A new method for performing a \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy was shown to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps\u2014and was a better experience for patients.", "author": "Laura Landro", "article.published": "2012-05-14T21:02:56-04:00", "article.updated": "2012-05-14T21:37:38-04:00", "article_publish": "2012-05-14 16:37", "article_publish_orig": "2012-05-14 16:02", "keywords": "Cancer,colonoscopy", "news_keywords": "Cancer,colonoscopy", "description": "A new method for performing a \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy was shown to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps\u2014and was a better experience for patients.", "article_section": "Business", "article_id": "BL-HEB-49283", "article_privilege": "free", "article.image_count": 2, "article_word_count": 491, "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "language": "en-US", "twitter": {"title": "New Method Easing Preparation May Encourage Colon Checks", "description": "A new method for performing a \u201cvirtual\u201d colonoscopy was shown to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps\u2014and was a better experience for patients.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "wsjhealthblog", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2012/05/14/new-method-easing-preparation-may-encourage-colon-checks/", "image": {"src": "https://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "domain": "WSJ.com"}, "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882, "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2012/05/14/new-method-easing-preparation-may-encourage-colon-checks/"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "referrer": "always"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1336968000.0, "source": "http://blogs.wsj.com", "summary": ""}
