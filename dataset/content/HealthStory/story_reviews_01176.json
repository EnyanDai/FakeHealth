(and then) we can have something ready to be introduced into the clinic,\u201d he told Reuters in Nicosia.\n\nDown\u2019s Syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation, occurring in 1 out of 700 live births worldwide.\n\nThe risk of having a baby with Down\u2019s \u2014 which occurs when a child has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two \u2014 increases sharply as women get older. The risk for a 40-year-old mother is 16 times that for one who is 25.\n\nDoctors currently use a test known as amniocentesis to check whether a baby is likely to be born with Down\u2019s. This test is generally done at about 15 or 16 weeks gestation and involves taking amniotic fluid from the mother by inserting a hollow needle into the uterus.\n\nSince amniocentesis carries a small risk of spontaneous miscarriage \u2014 Patsalis put it at around one or two percent \u2014 scientists have been looking for new less invasive ways to test for Down\u2019s and other potential genetic problems.\n\nPatsalis\u2019 method takes advantage of differences in the DNA methylation patterns \u2014 which are important to control levels of genes \u2014 between mother and fetus.\n\nIt involves taking a small amount of blood from the mother when she is between the 11th and 13th week of her pregnancy and detecting extra copies chromosome 21 in the fetus by analyzing the maternal blood.\n\nIn a small trial, Patsalis\u2019 team were able to correctly diagnose 14 cases where there were extra copies of the chromosome, and 26 normal fetuses \u2014 results they said highlighted its clinical potential.\n\n\u201cSuch a non-invasive approach will avoid the risk of miscarriages of normal pregnancies caused by current, more invasive procedures,\u201d the scientists wrote in their paper.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michele Kambas", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-downs-test-idUSTRE72523F20110306", "title": "Scientists develop blood test for Down's Syndrome", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Pregnant women may soon be able to have a blood test to predict whether their babies are likely to have Down's Syndrome instead of undergoing risky, invasive tests, scientists said on Sunday.", "Author": "Michele Kambas", "keywords": "US,DOWNS,TEST", "news_keywords": "US;DOWNS;TEST", "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Mar 06 18:13:17 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-03-06T18:13:17+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Michele Kambas", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-downs-test-idUSTRE72523F20110306", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Scientists develop blood test for Down's Syndrome", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,DOWNS,TEST", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-DOWNS-TEST", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Scientists develop blood test for Down's Syndrome", "sailthru.author": "Michele Kambas", "sailthru.date": "2011-03-06T18:13:17+0000", "sailthru.title": "Scientists develop blood test for Down's Syndrome", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Scientists develop blood test for Down's Syndrome", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-downs-test-idUSTRE72523F20110306", "type": "article", "description": "Pregnant women may soon be able to have a blood test to predict whether their ba...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-03-06T18:13:17+0000", "modified_time": "2011-03-06T18:13:17+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Michele Kambas", "tag": "US,DOWNS,TEST"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Scientists develop blood test for Down's Syndrome", "description": "Pregnant women may soon be able to have a blood test to predict whether their babies are likely to have Down's Syndrome instead of undergoing risky, invasive tests, scientists said on Sunday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
