While Peterson was reluctant to try it at first, his wife all but insisted, and as a result, she got her hiking partner back, and to hear Peterson tell it, he got his life back.\n\n\"It absolutely gave me almost immediate relief,\" he says. \"By wearing the brace, I could get back to sports and was able to call my physician and say 'why didn't we try this first?'\"\n\nKnee braces basically help realign the knee; taking pressure off of damaged areas to relieve pain and restore function. Bracing is one of a number of noninvasive ways to treat knee OA and/or delay the need for joint replacement surgery.\n\nNew research presented at a media briefing Tuesday in New York City suggests that Peterson is not the only one to find relief from knee bracing. In a new study, 49 people with knee OA aged 45 to 87 who wore a knee brace had less pain, stiffness, and disability after six months of use.\n\nAll study participants led active lifestyles before they got sidelined by knee OA, and said they hoped to return to their previous level of activities. And by and large, they did. Their quality of life improved, and their activity level went from one that did not permit recreational sports to one that did.\n\nThe brace used in the study was provided by Ossur, which also provided financial support to the study through a research grant and sponsored the media briefing. The study was also presented at the recent annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in New Orleans.", "images":
