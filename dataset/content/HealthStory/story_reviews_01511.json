It provides an image that has been magnified more than two times, the FDA says in a news release.\n\nAge-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects older people. It damages the center of the retina, or macula, and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. There are two forms of AMD, a wet form and a dry form.\n\nAbout 8 million people in the U.S. suffer from this condition, and nearly 2 million of them already have significant loss of vision. The device is intended for patients 75 and older with severe to profound vision impairment that has been stable over time due to blind spots from end-stage AMD.\n\n\"This innovation has the potential to provide many people with an improved quality of life,\" Jeffrey Shuren, MD, JD, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, says in the news release.\n\nThe IMT comes in two models; one model provides 2.2 times magnification and the other 2.7 times. It is designed to magnify and project images onto a healthy portion of the afflicted person's retina. It is intended for use in only one eye because the other eye is used for peripheral vision, the FDA says.\n\nBefore implantation, patients will be trained with an external telescopic device to see if they may benefit from the product. Training would also be needed to verify that there is sufficient peripheral vision in the untreated eye.\n\nThe miniature telescope was developed by VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies Inc. of Saratoga, Calif.\n\n\"This is truly a breakthrough technology for AMD patients as their treatment options have been limited until now,\" says Kathryn A. Colby, MD, PhD, an ophthalmic surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston and an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School.", "images":
