Several companies do not sell tests in China or India, where boys are prized over girls and fetuses found to be female have been aborted. While sex selection is not considered a widespread objective in the United States, companies say that occasionally customers expressed that interest, and have been denied the test. A recent study of third pregnancies in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis found that in some Asian-American groups, more boys than girls are born in ratios that are \u201cstrongly suggesting prenatal sex selection,\u201d the authors said.\n\nAt least one company, Consumer Genetics, which sells the Pink or Blue test, requires customers to sign a waiver saying they are not using the test for that purpose. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this technology to be used as a method of gender selection,\u201d said the company\u2019s executive vice president, Terry Carmichael. Sex-determination tests are part of a new frontier of fetal DNA testing, which can be used to determine paternity and blood type, and is being used to develop early screening tests for genetic diseases or disorders like Down syndrome.\n\nThe new study found that to be reliable, the sex-determination tests had to be performed after at least seven weeks of gestation. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother\u2019s blood, not urine. And certain rigorous laboratory procedures had to be followed. For the blood tests, women prick their fingers and send blood samples to labs. If the Y chromosome is detected, the fetus is male. Absence of a Y chromosome would probably mean the fetus is female, but could mean that fetal DNA was not found in that sample.\n\nThe tests are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration because they are not used for medical purposes, a spokeswoman said, but the agency is investigating the explosion of home genetic tests like these and genome-sequencing kits.\n\nPhoto\n\nDr. Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and the lead author of the sex-determination report, said, \u201cA very important aspect of the study is how this advances prenatal care.\u201d\n\nBut there are potential concerns too, she said, including that women may spend more than $250 for the tests when they don\u2019t have insurance for prenatal care. A typical blood test like Pink or Blue, for example, costs $25 for the kit. Lab fees and shipping costs, which vary, bring the total expense to $265 to $330.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Bianchi is conducting another study to \u201ctry to find out why people are buying these things and what are the consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These tests analyze hormones in women\u2019s urine, a method that several experts said has not been studied as rigorously as DNA. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.\n\nAnother company, TrovaGene, has developed a DNA test using urine, which, according to Gabriele Cerrone, TrovaGene\u2019s co-founder and director, is 95 percent accurate at predicting boys at seven weeks, and 88 percent accurate at predicting girls. TrovaGene is also developing a test for Down syndrome.\n\nMost DNA tests on the market use blood.\n\nRaylene Lewis, 34, of College Station, Tex., had a frustrating experience with a now-defunct company, Acu-Gen, which guaranteed 99.9 percent accuracy with its blood tests. In 2005, she was told she was having a boy, and she chose a name, bought boy clothes and told everyone. When an ultrasound revealed she was carrying a girl, \u201cI was absolutely shocked,\u201c she said. She was not unhappy, she said, but \u201cit was like the baby boy disappeared.\u201d\n\nWhen the Lewises complained to Acu-Gen\u2019s president, they were told, \u201cWe are very sure that genetically you are having a male,\u201d she said, reading a transcript of the conversation, which they recorded. The official suggested that the baby might be \u201cwhat a baby girl looks like on the outside,\u201d but that \u201cwe\u2019re giving you the results on the inside.\u201d\n\nMs. Lewis, who sued Acu-Gen, said she ultimately received a refund. Lawyers for Acu-Gen could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Pink or Blue test, which claims 95 percent accuracy at seven weeks and gives refunds for wrong results, appears to meet the standards described in the new study.\n\nChelsea Wallace, 23, of Okeechobee, Fla., was thrilled early this year when the test she took at seven weeks said she was having a boy, a result confirmed weeks later by ultrasound. Ms. Wallace, who has a 3-year-old daughter, said she also would have been happy with a girl, but that since she and her fianc\u00e9 could not agree on a boy\u2019s name, finding out early gave them time to choose the name Layton. It also helped her plan, she said.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I found out I was pregnant,\u201d said Ms. Wallace, whose son is due in September, \u201cI wanted to know what I was having.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/10/us/jp-BIRTH/jp-BIRTH-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/10/us/jp-BIRTH/jp-BIRTH-jumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/10/us/jp-BIRTH/jp-BIRTH-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pam Belluck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/health/10birth.html", "title": "Blood Test Can Tell Fetal Sex at 7 Weeks, Study Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000000990332", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/health/10birth.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/health/10birth.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000000990332"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/health/10birth.html", "title": "Blood Test Can Tell Fetal Sex at 7 Weeks, Study Says", "description": "A blood test is not regulated in the United States but is routinely used in Europe to assess gender-linked disorders.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "PamBelluck"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Is It Boy Or Girl?
