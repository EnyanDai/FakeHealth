Spinning blood samples in a centrifuge, researchers found they could break open those sacs and readily detect a protein called glypican-1, which is overexpressed in breast and pancreatic cancers.\n\nThe finding \u201coffers the possibility for early detection of pancreatic cancer and help in designing potential curative surgical options,\u201d the authors of the new research wrote. For a cancer that has already metastasized in four of five patients newly diagnosed, earlier detection holds a strong promise of improving pancreatic cancer\u2019s dismal survival rate, they added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPancreatic cancer is the deadliest of all common cancers in the United States. An estimated 44,000 are diagnosed with the malignancy each year in the country, usually when it has reached a very advanced stage and few treatment options are effective. Just 5% of those diagnosed with this form of malignancy survive five or more years.\n\nClotilde Thery, a cancer researcher at France\u2019s Institut Curie, greeted the possibility with enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cThe potential implications of such a test are huge,\u201d Thery wrote in an editorial published alongside the study, in the journal Nature. Although she said its findings need to be replicated in much larger groups, she hailed the finding as \u201cclinically important.\u201d\n\nUC San Francisco cancer physician Alan Venook cautioned, however, that much more needs to be known about the telltale sign of cancer explored in the new research before its lifesaving properties can be established.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe issue is, can you detect these in patients that don\u2019t have advanced cancer?\u201d Venook said. \u201cThe answer is, we don\u2019t know.\u201d The numbers tested by the MD Anderson researchers -- 251 patients with pancreatic cancer (five of whom had very early lesions), 32 with chronic pancreatitis and 120 healthy controls -- aren\u2019t nearly large enough to draw such conclusions. And getting a clear answer, Venook said, would probably require lengthy and expensive studies on very large populations.\n\n------------\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nJune 25, 4:06 p.m.: An earlier version of this article underreported the number of people tested for the glypican-1 protein by the MD Anderson researchers. Participants with pancreatic cancer numbered 251, not 56; healthy controls numbered 120, not 20; those with chronic pancreatitis numbered 32, not six.\n\n------------\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, this is where we start. This is a very cool observation, well worth following. But this is not a biomarker yet,\u201d Venook said.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and \u201clike\u201d Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a64ab6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1370x974+0+0/resize/840x597!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2Fed%2Fac0691c56d9a0c7fb382cbb05bcc%2Fla-sci-blood-test-pancreatic-cancer-20150624-001", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd585f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F12%2F57%2Fa343371429b7000ea37eaded8d93%2Fimg-534f3749-turbine-la-bio-melissa-healy", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5cbe91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1370x719+0+127/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2Fed%2Fac0691c56d9a0c7fb382cbb05bcc%2Fla-sci-blood-test-pancreatic-cancer-20150624-001"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5cbe91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1370x719+0+127/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2Fed%2Fac0691c56d9a0c7fb382cbb05bcc%2Fla-sci-blood-test-pancreatic-cancer-20150624-001", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Melissa Healy Is A Health", "Science Reporter With The Los Angeles Times Writing The Washington", "D.C.", "Area.
