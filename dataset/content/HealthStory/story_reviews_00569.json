Several studies suggest possible benefits in stroke and liver disease from vitamin extracts made from the oil, but so far there isn\u2019t proof that consuming the oil can ward off disease, scientists say.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not enough evidence to say that it\u2019s good for health, but if you like the flavor of it, now and then for an indulgence, I think it\u2019s OK,\u201d says Penny M. Kris-Etherton, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nRed palm oil is produced in several areas, including Malaysia, West Africa and Ecuador. Oil pressed from the flesh of the fruit of the palm tree is naturally a deep orange color. But most palm fruit oil is bleached and refined at high temperatures, resulting in a yellow oil used in the food and cosmetics industries, says Johari Minal, Washington, D.C., regional manager of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, a government agency that promotes the country\u2019s palm-oil industry. Red palm oil is refined either at lower temperatures or not heated at all during final processing, causing it to retain color and nutrients, he says.\n\nFlavors vary depending on the processing. Ola-Ola Carotino oil, $6.99 for 35.2 ounces, is heated briefly during refining and has a bland, neutral flavor comparable to other cooking oils, says Unnikrishnan R. Unnithan, executive director of Malaysia\u2019s Carotino Sdn. Bhd.; the company also sells a more flavorful version intended for ethnic cooking.\n\nPhoto: DANNY KIM FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\n\nOther oils, such as Nutiva Inc.\u2019s red palm oil from Ecuador, $8.99 for 15 ounces, are filtered instead of heated during refining. Nutiva\u2019s oil has a flavor some people say is like spicy carrots. It can be used as a salad dressing and drizzled on hummus and popcorn, says Nutiva Chief Executive John W. Roulac.\n\nA tablespoon of red palm oil is about 130 calories, similar to other oils. About 40% of red palm oil is oleic acid, an unsaturated fat present in higher quantities in olive oil and believed to be part of the reason for its heart benefits. Palmitic acid\u2014a saturated fat that makes up about another 40% of red palm oil and was long considered to be implicated in heart disease\u2014is \u201cneutral at best\u201d based on newer evidence, says David L. Katz, director of Yale University\u2019s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center. Healthwise, red palm oil is clearly preferable to oil made from the kernel, which is about 80% saturated fat and widely used in packaged foods, Dr. Katz says. But compared with known healthy oils such as olive, walnut, avocado and canola oil, which is rich in omega-3s, benefit is \u201cby no means obvious,\u201d he adds.\n\nThis product contains red palm oil extracts from Malaysia\u2019s ExcelVite.

A tablespoon of Nutiva oil contains 25% of the recommended daily serving of vitamin E and 240% of the recommended daily serving of vitamin A. According to a 2010 review published in the Journal of American College of Nutrition, scientists in developing countries have found Carotino and other red palm oils to be an effective method of treating vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to blindness.\n\nRed palm oil contains various types of vitamin E, including four tocotrienols, antioxidants some scientists think may be good for the cardiovascular system. In a two-year, 121-person study published in 2014 in the journal Stroke, a tocotrienol-rich dietary supplement made from red palm oil reduced \u201cwhite matter lesions,\u201d or small areas of damage to the brain that can be caused by strokes so minor a person might not be aware they happened; such small strokes can lead to cognitive impairment. The tocotrienols appear to have had a \u201cprotective effect\u201d resulting in less damage to brain tissues from the strokes, says co-author Kah Hay Yuen, a professor at the School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia.\n\nThe study was funded by the Malaysian palm board and Dr. Yuen is a paid consultant to Hovid Bhd., which sells the supplement; the same ingredient is available in the U.S. from various companies under the names EvNol Suprabio and Tocomin Suprabio, says Bryan See, a U.S. regional product manager for Malaysia\u2019s ExcelVite Sdn. Bhd., which supplies the ingredient. A 2013 study, also co-written by Dr. Yuen, found a beneficial effect on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nNutiva says red palm oil can be drizzled on popcorn.

A Page One article in The Wall Street Journal last week explored reports of forced labor and poor conditions for migrant workers on Malaysian palm oil plantations. All red palm oil from Malaysia, including Carotino, is produced by companies certified by the not-for-profit Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as using sustainable methods and using legal workers who make at least minimum wage, says the Malaysian palm oil board\u2019s Mr. Minal. The Roundtable\u2019s members include palm-oil producers and processors, consumer-goods manufacturers and some environmental and social groups. Nutiva says its oil is sustainably produced by family farms in Ecuador and workers are paid more than local minimum wage.\n\nWrite to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com", "images": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-125154?width=111&height=62", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ984_0803AC_D_20150731163505.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-124802?width=111&height=62", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-ES110_PARTNE_C_20190809085434.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191101/110419elevatorpai/110419elevatorpai_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ985_0803AC_H_20150731163505.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719electiontech2/110719electiontech2_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ984_0803AC_G_20150731163505.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ987_0803AC_H_20150731163505.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ986_0803AC_H_20150731163505.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FK672_STREAM_C_20191108185629.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719opvidpw3/110719opvidpw3_167x94.jpg", "https://images.wsj.net/im-101746?width=111&height=62", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191107/110719seib/110719seib_167x94.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ984_0803AC_H_20150731163505.jpg", "https://m.wsj.net/video/20191104/cinvest1105/cinvest1105_167x94.jpg"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JQ984_0803AC_G_20150731163505.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Johannes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-green-light-for-red-palm-oil-as-health-aid-1438621978", "title": "A Green Light for Red Palm Oil as Health Aid?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dj.asn": "i-0ac0", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "page.section": "Article", "page.content.type": "Article", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online", "article.template": "full", "page.site": "wsj", "page.site.product": "WSJ", "page.region": "na,us", "article.id": "SB11120473556046283797404581148302607582430", "article.type": "Aches & Claims", "article.type.display": "Aches & Claims", "article.access": "paid", "article.origheadline": "A Green Light for Red Palm Oil as Health Aid?", "article.headline": "A Green Light for Red Palm Oil as Health Aid?", "article.summary": "Its supporters say red palm oil is packed with healthy antioxidants and good for the heart.
