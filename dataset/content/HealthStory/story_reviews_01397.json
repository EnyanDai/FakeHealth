Thus, the relative reduction in mortality that was causally related to the screening program alone was 10 percent.\"\n\nThe publication notes that in 2002, the World Health Organization concluded that mammography screening for women between ages 50 and 69 reduced the death rate from breast cancer by 25 percent.\n\nResearchers said challenges in measuring the effectiveness of mammography screenings include increases in breast-cancer awareness and advances in treatment.", "images": ["http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/images/1.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/HEALTH/09/23/mammogram.study/tzvids.mammogram.cnn.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/mosaic/bttn_close.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/HEALTH/09/23/mammogram.study/story.mammogram.cnn.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/images/1.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/mosaic/15x15_PLUS_bt.jpg", "http://www.CNN.com/video/health/2010/05/04/hm.mammograms.and.age.cnn.640x360.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/icons/btn_close.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/1px.gif"], "top_img": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/HEALTH/09/23/mammogram.study/tzvids.mammogram.cnn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Cnn Wire Staff"], "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/09/23/mammogram.study/index.html", "title": "Study questions benefit of mammograms in women over 50", "meta_data": {"TITLE": "Study questions benefit of mammograms in women over 50 - CNN.com", "fb_title": "Study questions benefit of mammograms in women over 50", "description": "A new study released Thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 as previously thought.", "AUTHOR": "By the CNN Wire Staff", "SECTION": "HEALTH", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489, "page_id": 129343697106537}, "og": {"type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=1024"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.CNN.com", "summary": ""}
