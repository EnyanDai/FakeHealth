During an inflammatory response, immune cells flood the bloodstream with proteins known as cytokines.\n\nDrugs to counteract these cytokines are the newest generation of anti-inflammatories. Some are so new, clinical trials are still testing their efficacy and safety for human use.\n\nBased on previous findings about depression, the team looked at the side effects experienced by patients given anti-cytokine drugs in 20 separate studies. All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.\n\nRead More", "images": ["http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140905104323-depressed-man-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150602111258-prescription-pills-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160209132238-emerging-depression-treatments-00013816-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710175147-ibuprofen-stock-super-tease.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710175147-ibuprofen-stock-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susan Scutti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/health/anti-inflammatory-drugs-depression/index.html", "title": "Anti-inflammatory drugs might someday treat depression", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "health", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2016-10-18T20:10:23Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/health/anti-inflammatory-drugs-depression/index.html", "title": "Anti-inflammatory drugs might someday treat depression", "description": "A new class of anti-inflammatory drugs known as anti-cytokine drugs may be used to treat symptoms of depression in the future, say researchers.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710175147-ibuprofen-stock-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 900}}, "pubdate": "2016-10-18T20:10:23Z", "lastmod": "2016-10-18T20:10:23Z", "author": "Susan Scutti, CNN", "twitter": {"title": "Anti-inflammatory drugs might someday treat depression", "description": "A new class of anti-inflammatory drugs known as anti-cytokine drugs may be used to treat symptoms of depression in the future, say researchers.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710175147-ibuprofen-stock-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "A new class of anti-inflammatory drugs known as anti-cytokine drugs may be used to treat symptoms of depression in the future, say researchers.", "keywords": "Anti-cytokine drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, depression, major depression, auto-immune disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, health, Anti-inflammatory drugs might someday treat depression - CNN", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150710175147-ibuprofen-stock-super-tease.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/18/health/anti-inflammatory-drugs-depression/index.html"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content-tier": "free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "health,art-vid"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1476763200.0, "source": "http://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
