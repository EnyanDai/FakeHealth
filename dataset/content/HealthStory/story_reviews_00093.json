Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial.\n\nMore attractive to many men than a long-acting injection or topical gel\u2014both of which are in development\u2014the prototype pill offers a \u201cmajor step forward\u201d in male contraception, Stephanie Page, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and senior investigator on the study, said in a statement.\n\nThe once-daily prototype pill suppressed certain hormones to the low levels you'd expect to see with effective longer-term contraceptives, results from an ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society\u2019s annual meeting in Chicago, abstract show.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nPhilippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe prototype pill\u2014dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU)\u2014is somewhat similar to the combined female pill, which contains estrogen and a steroid hormone. Rather than estrogen, DMAU uses a male hormone like testosterone.\n\nCurrently available forms of testosterone can exit the body too quickly for use in a once-daily pill. The \u201cundecanoate\u201d in DMAU, however, is a long-chain fatty acid that can slow the drug\u2019s journey out of the body, Page said.\n\nEighty-three men took various doses of DMAU or a placebo for a month. Researchers analyzed the men\u2019s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. They found testosterone and two hormones needed for the production of sperm were notably suppressed in men who took the highest dose of DMAU.\n\nWhile some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain, DMAU appeared safe. All participants passed safety tests including liver and kidney health checks.\n\n\u201cDespite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,\u201d Page said. There were no significant changes in mood or sexual function, but a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study.\n\nPage has high hopes for the results, calling them \u201cunprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.\u201d Longer-term studies are the next step toward a once-daily male contraceptive pill, she said.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/small/public/2018/03/16/untitled-2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/small/public/2018/03/16/image-00.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/19/319contraceptive-pill.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/01/19/birthcontrolpills.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/small/public/2018/03/19/00-armies.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/small/public/2018/03/14/image-00.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/03/19/319contraceptive-pill.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/12/22/sperm-bank.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/02/23/gettyimages-158871156.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/19/319contraceptive-pill.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321/http://www.newsweek.com/male-contraceptive-birth-control-pill-850989", "title": "DMAU: Male Birth Control Pill Offers 'Unprecedented' Study Results", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "combined oral contraceptive pill, male contraceptive, birth control", "fb": {"app_id": 245537789135954, "pages": 18343191100}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321/http://www.newsweek.com/male-contraceptive-birth-control-pill-850989", "title": "A male birth control pill may finally be around the corner", "description": "Researchers say they have made a \"major step forward.\"", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/19/319contraceptive-pill.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek", "section": "Tech & Science", "modified_time": "2018-03-19T09:39:09-04:00", "published_time": "2018-03-19T09:36:26-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsweek", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A male birth control pill may finally be around the corner", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://www.newsweek.com/male-contraceptive-birth-control-pill-850989", "description": "Researchers say they have made a \"major step forward.\"", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180319145321im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/19/319contraceptive-pill.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/themes/newsweek/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "Researchers say they have made a \"major step forward.\""}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521466586.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
