People have been looking for something like this for years,\u201d said Dagan Wells of the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Oxford University.\n\nThe average age for menopause is 51, with ovulation in most women ending sometime between age 40 and 60. But it can happen later or earlier, making it difficult for women who want to develop a career before having babies to know how long to wait.\n\nTehrani\u2019s team took blood samples from 266 women aged between 20 and 49 who were also taking part in another study called the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, which started in 1998.\n\nThey then measured concentrations of a hormone called the anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) that is produced by cells in women\u2019s ovaries. AMH controls the development of follicles in the ovaries from which eggs develop, and the scientists suspected it might be useful for judging ovarian function.\n\nSTATISTICAL MODEL\n\nThe researchers took two more blood samples at three yearly intervals and also collected information on the women\u2019s socioeconomic background and reproductive history.\n\n\u201cWe developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a single measurement of AMH concentration,\u201d Tehrani explained in a report on the study. \u201cUsing this model, we estimated mean average ages at menopause for women at different time points in their reproductive life span.\u201d\n\nTehrani said the results showed \u201ca good level of agreement\u201d between predicted and actual age at menopause for the 63 women in the group who reached menopause during the study.\n\nThe average difference between the predicted age and the women\u2019s actual age at menopause was a third of a year, and the maximum margin of error was three to four years.\n\nWells said Tehrani\u2019s team appeared to have hit upon a \u201cfairly accurate algorithm\u201d for predicting menopause.\n\nBut said it would be important to see if the method could also help predict the time when fertility effectively ends.\n\n\u201cA woman may cease monthly ovulation and experience menopause at 50, but she will probably have been effectively infertile for several years prior to this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be important to let patients know that fertility will have declined greatly in the years preceding the final ovulation.\u201d", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-menopause-test-idUSTRE65Q0XW20100627", "title": "Scientists find way to predict timing of menopause", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause, offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "US,MENOPAUSE,TEST", "news_keywords": "US;MENOPAUSE;TEST", "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Jun 27 08:58:47 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-06-27T08:58:47+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-menopause-test-idUSTRE65Q0XW20100627", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Scientists find way to predict timing of menopause", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,MENOPAUSE,TEST", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-MENOPAUSE-TEST", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Scientists find way to predict timing of menopause", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2010-06-27T08:58:47+0000", "sailthru.title": "Scientists find way to predict timing of menopause", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Scientists find way to predict timing of menopause", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-menopause-test-idUSTRE65Q0XW20100627", "type": "article", "description": "Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-06-27T08:58:47+0000", "modified_time": "2010-06-27T08:58:47+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "US,MENOPAUSE,TEST"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Scientists find way to predict timing of menopause", "description": "Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause, offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
