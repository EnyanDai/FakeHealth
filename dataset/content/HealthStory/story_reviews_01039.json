And those in the top fifth of fiber intake were 11 percent less likely to do so than women in the bottom fifth.\n\nThat was after accounting for differences in risk factors like alcohol drinking, weight, hormone replacement therapy and family members with the disease.\n\nStill, it\u2019s impossible to rule out that big fiber eaters had healthier habits overall that would cut their risk, Jia-Yi Dong of Soochow University in Suzhou and his colleagues write in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n\nAnd the potential effect was \u201cvery small,\u201d Dr. Eleni Linos of Stanford University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nAbout one in eight American women get breast cancer at some point, with less than a quarter of them dying from it.\n\nAlthough the connection between breast cancer risk and fiber is a small one, fiber is \u201csomething that we know is healthy for you anyway,\u201d said Christina Clarke, a research scientist at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California in Fremont.\n\nKnown benefits of a high-fiber diet include lower cholesterol and weight loss. If it turns out to cut cancer risk as well, that would be an extra bonus, Clarke said.\n\nFruits, vegetables, beans, and whole grains are all high in fiber.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s 2010 Dietary Guidelines, most Americans don\u2019t get enough fiber. The guidelines recommend that women eat 25 grams of fiber per day and men eat 38 grams, while the average Americans gets just 15 grams a day.\n\n\u201cIncreasing dietary fiber intake in the general public is of great public health significance,\u201d the Chinese team concludes.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/qKtsU2 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, online July 20, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eric Schultz", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiber-breast-cancer-idUSTRE76R6YM20110728", "title": "Women who eat lots of fiber have less breast cancer", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A fresh look at the medical evidence shows women who eat more fiber are less likely to get breast cancer.", "Author": "Eric Schultz", "keywords": "US,FIBER,BREAST,CANCER", "news_keywords": "US;FIBER;BREAST;CANCER", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Jul 28 20:09:41 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-07-28T20:09:41+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Eric Schultz", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiber-breast-cancer-idUSTRE76R6YM20110728", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Women who eat lots of fiber have less breast cancer", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,FIBER,BREAST,CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-FIBER-BREAST-CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Women who eat lots of fiber have less breast cancer", "sailthru.author": "Eric Schultz", "sailthru.date": "2011-07-28T20:09:41+0000", "sailthru.title": "Women who eat lots of fiber have less breast cancer", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Women who eat lots of fiber have less breast cancer", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiber-breast-cancer-idUSTRE76R6YM20110728", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A fresh look at the medical evidence shows women who eat more...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-07-28T20:09:41+0000", "modified_time": "2011-07-28T20:09:41+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Eric Schultz", "tag": "US,FIBER,BREAST,CANCER"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Women who eat lots of fiber have less breast cancer", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A fresh look at the medical evidence shows women who eat more fiber are less likely to get breast cancer.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1311825600.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
