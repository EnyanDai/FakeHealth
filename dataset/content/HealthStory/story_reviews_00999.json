In the study, patients who received monthly gantenerumab injections showed reductions in such brain plaques.\n\nWhat is not entirely known at this point, though, is if these plaques cause Alzheimer's or are by-products of the disease. Therefore, it's not known if reducing the amount of them will slow or stop the disease.", "images":
