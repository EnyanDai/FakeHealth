The lower dose seemed more effective than the higher one. Those who received placebos got worse.\n\nA third also had scans to assess their brains\u2019 use of glucose. One hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is reduced metabolism in the brain, which shows up on scans as less use of glucose, the fuel for brain cells. In this assessment, those getting insulin used more glucose in their brains; those taking placebos used less.\n\nFor years, the study\u2019s principal investigator, Suzanne Craft, has studied insulin\u2019s effects in Alzheimer\u2019s. She is professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the memory disorders clinic at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System.\n\nBrain cells need insulin, Dr. Craft said. And conditions in which the body makes too little insulin or is resistant to its effects \u2014 diabetes, prediabetes, even untreated high-blood pressure \u2014 are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The problem was to find a way to get more insulin to the brain but not to the body.\n\nThe solution was a special device made by Kurve Technology that delivers a spray of insulin deep into the nose. From there the hormone travels along the path of nerves into the brain.\n\nThe investigators first tried a single dose of insulin delivered via nasal spray to the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Their memories improved temporarily. Then they tried giving insulin daily for three weeks. Again, the hormone seemed to help. That led to the current study, lasting four months.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Martha Daviglus of Northwestern University, who led a panel last year that assessed published papers on preventing and treating Alzheimer\u2019s, urged caution. In her field, cardiovascular medicine, she has seen many exciting findings in small studies that fall apart in larger or longer ones.\n\nNow Dr. Craft wants to test insulin again in a much more extensive study. .\n\nIn the meantime, she cautions Alzheimer\u2019s patients not to rush out and try to take insulin. It is too soon to say if the treatment is even safe, she said. And patients would need a special device to get it deep into the nose. Kurve\u2019s device is not yet on the market.\n\n\u201cThe individual person will not be able to get this device,\u201d Dr. Craft said. But, she added, if her study goes forward, many will be able to participate in it.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Kolata"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/health/research/13alzheimers.html", "title": "Squirts of Insulin May Help Those With Early Alzheimer\u2019s", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001048719", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/health/research/13alzheimers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/health/research/13alzheimers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001048719"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/health/research/13alzheimers.html", "title": "Squirts of Insulin May Help Those With Early Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "An intriguing study suggests that aerosolized insulin may help people who are in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "ginakolata"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "A Squirt Of Insulin May Delay Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "An intriguing study suggests that aerosolized insulin may help people who are in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 100000001048719, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Squirts of Insulin May Help Those With Early Alzheimer\u2019s", "pdate": 20110912, "utime": 20140829170425, "ptime": 20110912144424, "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 12, 2011", "dat": "Sept. 12, 2011", "lp": "An intriguing study suggests that aerosolized insulin may help people who are in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "13alzheimers", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2011-09-12T14:44:24-04:00", "modified": "2014-08-29T17:04:25-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/gina.kolata.1", "tag": "Research"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/health/research/13alzheimers.html", "type": "article", "title": "Squirts of Insulin May Help Those With Early Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "An intriguing study suggests that aerosolized insulin may help people who are in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Gina Kolata", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By GINA KOLATA", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "research", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Research", "keywords": "Alzheimer's Disease,Insulin,Medicine and Health,Research", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/research", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1315886400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
