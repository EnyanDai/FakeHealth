Natural remedies have an obvious appeal, but how do you know which ones to choose and whether the claims are backed by science? In this occasional series, the New York Times \u201cReally?\u201d columnist, Anahad O\u2019Connor, explores the claims and the science behind alternative remedies that you may want to consider for your family medicine cabinet.\n\nThe Remedy: Honey\n\nThe Claim: It relieves coughing.\n\nThe Science: For decades, parents looking for an over-the-counter medicine to cure a child\u2019s sickness and coughing have turned to syrupy medicines containing dextromethorphan, a popular cough suppressant found in products like Children\u2019s Dimetapp DM and Robitussin DM.\n\nBut in 2007, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel declared the products potentially harmful in small children and recommended a ban on many of them. As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.\n\nThe thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.\n\nIn one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.\n\nThe study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.\n\nThe Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/09/17/health/15well_cabinet/articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/marketing/newsletters/images/Running_75.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/well/well_post.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/../../images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/../../images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anahad O'Connor", "Topics.Nytimes.Com Topics Reference Timestopics People O Anahad_Oconnor Index.Html", "Latha Rajamani", "Slo Citizen", "Jon Webb", "Theresa Ayala", "Eduard Burt", "D.C.", "Dad Of Two", "Mommy Babs"], "canonical_link": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/remedies-honey-for-coughing/", "title": "Remedies: Honey for Coughing", "meta_data": {"PT": "Blogs", "PST": "Blog Post", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000000495937, "author": "Anahad O'Connor", "CLMST": "Anahad O'Connor", "byl": "Anahad O'Connor", "article": {"author": "//topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/o/anahad_oconnor/index.html", "published_time": 1292508565, "modified_time": "2010-12-16T14:09:25-05:00", "section": "Health", "tag": "Alternative Medicine", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp"}, "GBLC": "Alternative Medicine", "PUV": "normal", "PUD": 20101216, "pdate": 20101216, "ptime": 20101216090925, "utime": 20101216140925, "DISPLAYDATE": "December 16, 2010", "dat": "December 16, 2010", "CG": "Health", "SCG": "well", "BN": "well", "robots": "noodp", "des": "Alternative and Complementary Medicine", "keywords": "Alternative and Complementary Medicine,Alternative Medicine", "description": "honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under the age of 1.", "hdl": "Remedies: Honey for Coughing", "og": {"title": "Remedies: Honey for Coughing", "type": "article", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/remedies-honey-for-coughing/", "site_name": "Well", "description": "honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under the age of 1.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/../../images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Remedies: Honey for Coughing", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/remedies-honey-for-coughing/", "description": "honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under the age of 1.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nytimeswell"}, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well", "categories": "alternative-medicine"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1292475600.0, "source": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
