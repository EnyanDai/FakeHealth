REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe patient, who had both HIV infection and leukemia, received the bone marrow transplant in 2007 from a donor who had a genetic mutation known to give patients a natural immunity to the virus.\n\nNearly four years after the transplant, the patient is free of the virus and it does not appear to be hiding anywhere in his body, Thomas Schneider of Berlin Charite hospital and colleagues said.\n\n\u201cOur results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,\u201d they wrote in the journal Blood.\n\nAIDS researchers have rejected the approach on any kind of scale for patients with HIV. A bone marrow transplant is a last-ditch treatment for cancers such as leukemia.\n\nIt requires destruction of a patient\u2019s own bone marrow \u2014 itself a harrowing process \u2014 and then a transplant from a donor who has a near-exact blood and immune system type. Months of recovery are needed while the transplant grows and reconstitutes the patient\u2019s immune system.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not practical and it can kill people,\u201d said Dr. Robert Gallo of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, who helped discover the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.\n\n\u201cIt is possibly a cure, that\u2019s for sure, you won\u2019t know for absolute sure until the person dies and undergoes extreme PCR (genetic) analysis of post-mortem tissue.\u201d\n\nThe mutation affects a receptor, a cellular doorway, called CCR5, that the AIDS virus uses to get into the cells it infects.\n\nSince the 1990s scientists have known that some people, mostly of Northern European descent, have the mutation and are rarely infected with HIV.\n\n\u201cThey are uninfectable, virtually,\u201d Gallo said.\n\nSome researchers are working on the idea of gene therapy to treat or try to cure HIV, but the technology is still in experimental stages.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to throw cold water on an interesting thing, but that\u2019s what it is \u2014 an interesting thing,\u201d Gallo said.\n\nSchneider\u2019s team has been following the patient, taking samples from his colon, liver, spinal fluid and brain as he developed various conditions that justified the tests. They tested all these samples for evidence of the virus, which can be difficult to detect unless it is actively infecting cells.\n\nAll these places are suspected \u201creservoirs\u201d where HIV can hide out for years, to rebound in patients who stop taking drugs that suppress the infection.\n\nThis patient appears to have a fully functioning immune system, they found, which appears genetically identical to cells from the donor \u2014 not the patient\u2019s own immune cells.\n\nSchneider\u2019s team found no evidence of HIV anywhere.\n\n\u201cFrom these results, it is reasonable to conclude that cure of HIV infection has been achieved in this patient,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe AIDS virus infects 33 million people globally and has killed more than 25 million since the pandemic began in the 1980s. Cocktails of strong drugs can suppress the virus, keeping patients healthy and reducing the chance they will infect others, but there is no vaccine.", "images": ["http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101215&t=2&i=277130956&r=2010-12-15T235626Z_01_BTRE6BE1UI500_RTROPTP_0_CHINA-AIDS&w=20", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101215&t=2&i=277130956&w=1200&r=2010-12-15T235626Z_01_BTRE6BE1UI500_RTROPTP_0_CHINA-AIDS"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101215&t=2&i=277130956&w=1200&r=2010-12-15T235626Z_01_BTRE6BE1UI500_RTROPTP_0_CHINA-AIDS", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Fox", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aids-transplant-idUSTRE6BE68220101215", "title": "German doctors declare \"cure\" in HIV patient", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;everythingNews;scienceNews;healthNews;US-The-Wire;USWire_EL", "description": "German researchers who used a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer patient with the AIDS virus, have declared him cured of the virus -- a stunning claim in a field where the word \"cure\" is barely whispered.", "Author": "Maggie Fox", "keywords": "Chris Wilson,US,AIDS,TRANSPLANT", "news_keywords": "Chris Wilson;US;AIDS;TRANSPLANT", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Dec 15 23:56:29 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-12-15T23:56:29+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Maggie Fox", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aids-transplant-idUSTRE6BE68220101215", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "German doctors declare \"cure\" in HIV patient", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Chris Wilson,US,AIDS,TRANSPLANT", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-AIDS-TRANSPLANT", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "German doctors declare \"cure\" in HIV patient", "sailthru.author": "Maggie Fox", "sailthru.date": "2010-12-15T23:56:29+0000", "sailthru.title": "German doctors declare \"cure\" in HIV patient", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "German doctors declare \"cure\" in HIV patient", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aids-transplant-idUSTRE6BE68220101215", "type": "article", "description": "German researchers who used a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer patient w...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101215&t=2&i=277130956&w=1200&r=2010-12-15T235626Z_01_BTRE6BE1UI500_RTROPTP_0_CHINA-AIDS", "article": {"published_time": "2010-12-15T23:56:29+0000", "modified_time": "2010-12-15T23:56:29+0000", "section": "World", "author": "Maggie Fox", "tag": "Chris Wilson,US,AIDS,TRANSPLANT"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "German doctors declare \"cure\" in HIV patient", "description": "German researchers who used a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer patient with the AIDS virus, have declared him cured of the virus -- a stunning claim in a field where the word \"cure\" ...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101215&t=2&i=277130956&w=1200&r=2010-12-15T235626Z_01_BTRE6BE1UI500_RTROPTP_0_CHINA-AIDS", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101215&t=2&i=277130956&w=1200&r=2010-12-15T235626Z_01_BTRE6BE1UI500_RTROPTP_0_CHINA-AIDS"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article - News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "World - World", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "World", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "World", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1292457389.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
