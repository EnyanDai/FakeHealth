They also looked at questionnaires completed by their mothers to see how much folic acid they were consuming in the month before they became pregnant and during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, a critical period of embryonic brain development. Health officials in Norway recommend that pregnant women (and women who are trying to get pregnant) take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the 85,176 children in the study, 270 (or 0.32%) received an ASD diagnosis \u2013 114 (0.13%) had autistic disorder, 56 (0.07%) had Asperger syndrome and 100 (0.12%) were diagnosed with \u201cpervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified,\u201d or PPD-NOS.\n\nThese children were more likely to be born to women who did not take folic acid. In the raw analysis, mothers who skipped the supplement were more than 2.1 times more likely to have a child with autistic disorder compared with mothers who took the supplement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut not all mothers were equally likely to take folic acid supplements. Those who did were more likely to have attended college, to be nonsmokers, to be first-time mothers and to have planned their pregnancies. The researchers also found that the popularity of folic acid supplements rose as time went on. After the researchers controlled for factors like these, they calculated that taking the supplements was associated with a 39% lower risk of having a child with autistic disorder.\n\nThe raw numbers also showed that women who took extra folic acid were less likely to have kids with Asperger syndrome or PPD-NOS, but when other factors were taken into account, the association was no longer statistically significant and could have been due to chance, the researchers found.\n\nThe results were published in Wednesday\u2019s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.\n\nThe study also looked at folic acid use later in pregnancy but found no correlation between that and the chances of a child developing an autism spectrum disorder. Nor did they find any link between fish oil supplements and risk of ASDs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how these findings apply to mothers and children in the United States. Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed much more frequently in the U.S. than in Norway.\n\nOn the other hand, pregnant women here are also far more likely to consume a healthy amount of the B vitamin because the Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers of enriched breads, cereals and other grains to fortify them with folic acid since 1998. As a result, a cup of enriched white long-grain rice now contains 797 micrograms of folic acid, for example, and a cup of Cheerios has 493 mcg, according to this report from the Harvard Women\u2019s Health Watch.\n\nThe fact that autism cases have been on the rise in the U.S. even after folic acid supplementation became mandatory is a puzzle, according to three researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division of Birth Defects and Developmental Disorders. In an editorial that accompanies the JAMA study, they write that the discrepancy \u201cmay be attributable to changes in diagnosis and surveillance but also may reflect a concurrent real increase in the risk of ASDs attributable to as-yet undescribed risk factors and exposures.\u201d They also note that data from the National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey published in 2009 show that the typical American consumes only 150 mcg of folic acid per day even with mandatory fortification.\n\nYou can read a summary of the study and the editorial on the JAMA website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReturn to the Booster Shots blog.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ee1f47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/347x500+0+0/resize/840x1210!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2F26%2F15a20674c6dc50ced7108fa9d125%2Fla-xpm-photo-2013-feb-12-la-heb-autism-folic-acid-20130212", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3afa893/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe0%2Fdd%2F1e02d40e5e8b6b703354371b65f0%2Fimg-53608799-turbine-la-bio-karen-kaplan", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad1ac7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/347x182+0+159/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2F26%2F15a20674c6dc50ced7108fa9d125%2Fla-xpm-photo-2013-feb-12-la-heb-autism-folic-acid-20130212"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad1ac7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/347x182+0+159/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F06%2F26%2F15a20674c6dc50ced7108fa9d125%2Fla-xpm-photo-2013-feb-12-la-heb-autism-folic-acid-20130212", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Kaplan Is Science", "Medicine Editor At The Los Angeles Times.
