Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave. The NHS website explains that it is \u201cbased on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle\u201d.\n\nCBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.\n\nWhile studies have highlighted the short-term benefits of CBT, until now question marks have been raised about whether it can have long-term effects.\n\nThe study, one of the largest randomised control trials to be held in the developing world, followed women diagnosed with depression mid-pregnancy in 40 communities in rural Pakistan. Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.\n\nReturning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group. The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending. There were also big improvements in their parenting style.\n\nThe study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term.\n\n\u201cThese findings on the longer-term benefits at seven years post-treatment are really exciting,\u201d Bhalotra said. \u201cThis is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression. We have seen that CBT has changed how many of the treated women live their lives now \u2013 their mental health has improved, their financial situation and their empowerment over their lives, and undoubtedly the way they interact with their children.\u201d", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif",
