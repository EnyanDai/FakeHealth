That, in turn, may rev up inflammation in their tissues.\n\nIn the study, funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health, 101 patients were randomly assigned to either a concoction without pomegranate juice, or the real thing.\n\nAfter downing about half a cup three times a week over a year, those who drank the real thing had a reduction of inflammatory molecules in their blood.\n\nThey also made fewer trips to the hospital.\n\n\u201cWe found significant reductions in hospitalization due to infections, with more than 40 percent reduction in the first hospitalization and 80 percent in the second,\u201d said Kristal.\n\nHowever, the researchers were only able to rule out chance as the cause of the reduction in the second visit to the hospital.\n\nAccording to the findings, among 50 patients drinking pomegranate juice for a year, about two would have to go to the hospital at least twice. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice.\n\nThe researchers say they don\u2019t know if their results extend to other brands as well, and suggest squeezing your own juice. A 16-oz bottle of POM Wonderful sells for about $4.\n\nShe said her team had found no side effects, but added that kidney patients should be aware of the high potassium content in the juice, given the delicate balance of nutrients in their blood, and talk to their doctor if they consider drinking it.\n\nBrosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm.\n\n\u201cI would prefer to see this validated at other centers before we come out and say this is the thing to do,\u201d he said. Even if the findings hold up, he said, it is still unclear what accounts for them. \u201cWho the heck knows what the active ingredients are?\u201d\n\nMarion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.\n\n\u201cThis study does not demonstrate anything special about pomegranate juice,\u201d she told Reuters Health in an e-mail. \u201cThe effects of juice were compared to a placebo, not to any other kind of juice that might have exactly the same effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pomegranate people are spending millions to prove what I could have told them in the first place,\u201d she added. \u201cPomegranate juices \u2014 like most if not all fruit and vegetable juices \u2014 have antioxidant activity. Does this make pomegranates better than any other fruit? Investigators have yet to show this.\u201d", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pomegranate-juice-idUSTRE6AL3C120101122", "title": "Pomegranate juice could help kidney patients", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - There may be a seed of truth amidst the many health claims for pomegranate juice, researchers from Israel said Thursday, at least for kidney patients on dialysis.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "Israel,United States,Batya Kristal,Frank Brosius,Marion Nestle,US,POMEGRANATE,JUICE", "news_keywords": "Israel;United States;Batya Kristal;Frank Brosius;Marion Nestle;US;POMEGRANATE;JUICE", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Nov 22 15:15:42 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-11-22T15:15:42+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pomegranate-juice-idUSTRE6AL3C120101122", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Pomegranate juice could help kidney patients", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Israel,United States,Batya Kristal,Frank Brosius,Marion Nestle,US,POMEGRANATE,JUICE", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-POMEGRANATE-JUICE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Pomegranate juice could help kidney patients", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2010-11-22T15:15:42+0000", "sailthru.title": "Pomegranate juice could help kidney patients", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Pomegranate juice could help kidney patients", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pomegranate-juice-idUSTRE6AL3C120101122", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - There may be a seed of truth amidst the many health claims fo...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-11-22T15:15:42+0000", "modified_time": "2010-11-22T15:15:42+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "Israel,United States,Batya Kristal,Frank Brosius,Marion Nestle,US,POMEGRANATE,JUICE"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Pomegranate juice could help kidney patients", "description": "(Reuters Health) - There may be a seed of truth amidst the many health claims for pomegranate juice, researchers from Israel said Thursday, at least for kidney patients on dialysis.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1290438942.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
