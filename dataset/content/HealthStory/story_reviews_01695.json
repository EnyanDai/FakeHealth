REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Coffee, tea, or decaf-no matter what your choice, drinking any of these beverages may reduce your risk of diabetes, according to a new analysis of 18 studies including hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nA 2005 research review concluded that people who drank the most coffee were one-third less likely to develop diabetes than those who drank the least, Dr. Rachel Huxley of The University of Sydney, Australia, and colleagues note. In the years since then, they add, the amount of research on coffee and diabetes risk \u201chas more than doubled,\u201d while other studies have suggested that tea and decaf coffee may also be preventive.\n\nTo update the evidence, Huxley and her team analyzed 18 studies on coffee, decaf, and tea and the risk of type 2 diabetes published between 1966 and 2009, including just shy of 458,000 people in all.\n\nType 2 diabetes, which is often tied to obesity, affects about 8 percent of the U.S. population, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nFor every additional cup of coffee a person consumed each day, the study\u2019s authors found, a person\u2019s risk of diabetes was reduced by 7 percent. In the six studies that looked at decaf coffee, the researchers found, people who consumed more than three or four cups a day were at 36 percent lower risk of diabetes. And in seven studies that examined tea drinking and diabetes risk, people who drank more than three or four cups daily were at 18 percent lower diabetes risk.\n\nThe current analysis could have overestimated the effect of these beverages on diabetes risk due to statistical issues with the smaller studies, Huxley and her colleagues note. It\u2019s also not possible to say from the current evidence that heavy coffee drinkers (and tea and decaf drinkers) don\u2019t have other characteristics that might protect them against developing diabetes, they add, such as eating a healthier diet.\n\nThe fact that the effects were seen with decaf as well as coffee and tea suggest that if the effects are real, they aren\u2019t just due to caffeine, but may be related to other substances found in these beverages, the researchers say, for example magnesium, lignans (estrogen-like chemicals found in plants), or chlorogenic acids, which are antioxidants that slow the release of sugar into the blood after a meal.\n\nClinical trials are needed to investigate whether these beverages do indeed help prevent diabetes, the researchers say. If the benefits turn out to be real, they add, health care providers might begin advising patients at risk for diabetes not only to exercise and lose weight, but to drink more tea and coffee, too.\n\nSOURCE: Archives of Internal Medicine, December 14/28, 2009.", "images": ["https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091214&t=2&i=31374974&w=1200&r=2009-12-14T212507Z_01_BTRE5BD1NHY00_RTROPTP_0_US-PREVENT-DIABETES", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091214&t=2&i=31374974&r=2009-12-14T212507Z_01_BTRE5BD1NHY00_RTROPTP_0_US-PREVENT-DIABETES&w=20"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091214&t=2&i=31374974&w=1200&r=2009-12-14T212507Z_01_BTRE5BD1NHY00_RTROPTP_0_US-PREVENT-DIABETES", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-prevent-diabetes-idUSTRE5BD50N20091214", "title": "More evidence coffee, tea could prevent diabetes", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Coffee, tea, or decaf-no matter what your choice, drinking any of these beverages may reduce your risk of diabetes, according to a new analysis of 18 studies including hundreds of thousands of people.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "Australia,United States,Rachel Huxley,US,PREVENT,DIABETES", "news_keywords": "Australia;United States;Rachel Huxley;US;PREVENT;DIABETES", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Dec 14 21:25:09 UTC 2009", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2009-12-14T21:25:09+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-prevent-diabetes-idUSTRE5BD50N20091214", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "More evidence coffee, tea could prevent diabetes", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Australia,United States,Rachel Huxley,US,PREVENT,DIABETES", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-PREVENT-DIABETES", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "More evidence coffee, tea could prevent diabetes", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2009-12-14T21:25:09+0000", "sailthru.title": "More evidence coffee, tea could prevent diabetes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "More evidence coffee, tea could prevent diabetes", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-prevent-diabetes-idUSTRE5BD50N20091214", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Coffee, tea, or decaf-no matter what your choice, drinking an...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091214&t=2&i=31374974&w=1200&r=2009-12-14T212507Z_01_BTRE5BD1NHY00_RTROPTP_0_US-PREVENT-DIABETES", "article": {"published_time": "2009-12-14T21:25:09+0000", "modified_time": "2009-12-14T21:25:09+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "Australia,United States,Rachel Huxley,US,PREVENT,DIABETES"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "More evidence coffee, tea could prevent diabetes", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Coffee, tea, or decaf-no matter what your choice, drinking any of these beverages may reduce your risk of diabetes, according to a new analysis of 18 studies including hundreds of t...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091214&t=2&i=31374974&w=1200&r=2009-12-14T212507Z_01_BTRE5BD1NHY00_RTROPTP_0_US-PREVENT-DIABETES", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091214&t=2&i=31374974&w=1200&r=2009-12-14T212507Z_01_BTRE5BD1NHY00_RTROPTP_0_US-PREVENT-DIABETES"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1260825909.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
