REUTERS/Andrew Biraj\n\nExperts described the study results as phenomenal and said the device, developed by German researchers, could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nThe device \u2014 known as a sub-retinal implant \u2014 sits underneath the retina and works by directly replacing light receptors that are lost as a result of the disease.\n\nAfter the light detection stage, it uses the eye\u2019s natural image-processing functions to produce a stable visual image.\n\nEberhart Zrenner, chairman of the University of Tuebingen Eye Hospital in Germany and director of a small company called Retinal Implant AG which is developing the device, said the trial results were a \u201cproof of concept\u201d and would now be taken into further trials in around 25 to 50 patients in Europe.\n\n\u201cWe have shown that people can be provided with enough useful vision for daily life,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\nAccording to the study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal, one blind patient who had the device implanted was able to identify and find objects placed on a table in front of him, and was able to walk around a room independently.\n\nHe could even read a clock face and differentiate between seven shades of grey, the researchers said. Tests were conducted starting from seven to nine days after the device was implanted.\n\nThe implant device, which sits completely within the eye, is a tiny plate, measuring just 3 mm squared and a 10th of a millimeter thick, which has around 1,500 tiny light sensors connected to amplifiers and electrodes.\n\nOther types of retinal implants, known as epiretinal implants, sit outside the retina and because they bypass the intact light-sensitive structures in the eyes they require the patient to wear an external camera and processor unit.\n\nRobert Maclaren, a professor of Ophthalmology at Britain\u2019s Oxford University and a consultant retinal surgeon at the Oxford Eye Hospital, who was not involved in this trial, said he was \u201cvery excited\u201d by Zrenner\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cIt proves the concept that in a patient who has been blind for many years and is unable to see anything, the optic nerves can be re-awakened for them to be able to see again. It\u2019s of phenomenal significance in that regard,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\n\u201cTo go from being completely blind for many years, to being able to read a few letters and see shapes is an amazing step.\u201d\n\nRetinitis pigmentosa in a genetic eye condition that leads to blindness and affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide.\n\nZrenner said further trials of the implant should be completed in two to three years and if those proved successful the device could be on the market and available for thousands of patients in about five years\u2019 time.\n\nHe was cautious about possible wider applications, but said that if it was developed further, the device may someday be used to help people with severe cases of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older people.", "images": ["http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101103&t=2&i=240559332&r=2010-11-03T120049Z_01_BTRE6A20XDU00_RTROPTP_0_BANGLADESH&w=20", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101103&t=2&i=240559332&w=1200&r=2010-11-03T120049Z_01_BTRE6A20XDU00_RTROPTP_0_BANGLADESH"], "top_img": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101103&t=2&i=240559332&w=1200&r=2010-11-03T120049Z_01_BTRE6A20XDU00_RTROPTP_0_BANGLADESH", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blindness-retinal-implant-idUSTRE6A200C20101103", "title": "Retinal implant trial helps blind people see shapes", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "scienceNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "scienceNews;everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Scientists have developed an eye implant that allowed three blind patients to see shapes and objects within days of treatment in a trial and say the device could become routine for some kinds of blindness in five years.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "US,BLINDNESS,RETINAL,IMPLANT", "news_keywords": "US;BLINDNESS;RETINAL;IMPLANT", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Nov 03 12:01:06 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-11-03T12:01:06+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blindness-retinal-implant-idUSTRE6A200C20101103", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Retinal implant trial helps blind people see shapes", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,BLINDNESS,RETINAL,IMPLANT", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-BLINDNESS-RETINAL-IMPLANT", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Retinal implant trial helps blind people see shapes", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2010-11-03T12:01:06+0000", "sailthru.title": "Retinal implant trial helps blind people see shapes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Retinal implant trial helps blind people see shapes", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blindness-retinal-implant-idUSTRE6A200C20101103", "type": "article", "description": "Scientists have developed an eye implant that allowed three blind patients to se...", "image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101103&t=2&i=240559332&w=1200&r=2010-11-03T120049Z_01_BTRE6A20XDU00_RTROPTP_0_BANGLADESH", "article": {"published_time": "2010-11-03T12:01:06+0000", "modified_time": "2010-11-03T12:01:06+0000", "section": "Technology", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "US,BLINDNESS,RETINAL,IMPLANT"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Retinal implant trial helps blind people see shapes", "description": "Scientists have developed an eye implant that allowed three blind patients to see shapes and objects within days of treatment in a trial and say the device could become routine for some kinds of blind...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101103&t=2&i=240559332&w=1200&r=2010-11-03T120049Z_01_BTRE6A20XDU00_RTROPTP_0_BANGLADESH", "src": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101103&t=2&i=240559332&w=1200&r=2010-11-03T120049Z_01_BTRE6A20XDU00_RTROPTP_0_BANGLADESH"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/tech/science/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article -
