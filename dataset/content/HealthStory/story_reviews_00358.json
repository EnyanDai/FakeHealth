Not so long ago, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that allergenic foods be kept away from infants until they were at least a year old, and often older. That warning was especially strong for those with a family history of allergies. But, as an editorial published in the same issue of JAMA points out, in the next decade, food allergy prevalence nearly doubled in the United States.\n\nThat advice has been amended, and newer evidence has shown that introducing foods earlier is actually better for preventing food allergies. The authors of the just-published study reviewed all of the available evidence on the topic and included 146 studies in their final analysis.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

Eggs, too, showed this association when they were introduced between ages 4 and 6 months. Early introduction of another common allergen, fish, was also linked to less allergy\u2014possibly due to the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3s\u2014though evidence for this link wasn\u2019t as certain.\n\nEarly introduction didn\u2019t seem to make a difference for autoimmune diseases, at least according to the available evidence; eating gluten young wasn\u2019t associated with the risk of developing celiac disease.\n\nExactly why is a question researchers are still exploring. \u201cIt is not clear that it is the specific early introduction of an allergenic food that renders immunological protection, rather than the accompanying increased diversity in the diet that occurs as a by-product,\u201d writes Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, an allergy and immunology specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, in the accompanying editorial. More research is necessary to figure out the ideal amounts of these allergens, the optimum times of introduction and the reasons behind the link.\n\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com.", "images": ["https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/peanuts.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/hamburgers-and-fries.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/soda-can-drink-diet-health-fitness.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/peanuts.jpg", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/peanuts.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mandy Oaklander"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4501203/peanuts-food-allergy/", "title": "Eating Eggs and Peanuts Early Lowers Risk of Food Allergies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "allergies,allergy,celiac disease,diet,Diet/Nutrition,food allergies,food allergy,omega 3s,peanut,peanut allergies,peanut allergy,Peanuts", "news_keywords": "diet, peanuts, peanut, peanut allergy, peanut allergies, allergy, allergies, food allergy, food allergies, celiac disease, omega 3s,", "description": "Food allergies have doubled in recent years, but evidence suggests that feeding kids peanuts and eggs early reduces risk", "og": {"title": "Eating Eggs and Peanuts Early Lowers Risk of Food Allergies", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4501203/peanuts-food-allergy/", "description": "Food allergies have doubled in recent years, but evidence suggests that feeding kids peanuts and eggs early reduces risk", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/peanuts.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4501203/peanuts-food-allergy/", "description": "Food allergies have doubled in recent years, but evidence suggests that feeding kids peanuts and eggs early reduces risk", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/peanuts.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4501203/peanuts-food-allergy/", "title": "Eating Eggs and Peanuts Early Lowers Risk of Food Allergies", "description": "Food allergies have doubled in recent years, but evidence suggests that feeding kids peanuts and eggs early reduces risk", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/peanuts.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
