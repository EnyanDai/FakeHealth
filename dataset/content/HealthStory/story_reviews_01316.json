Above, Medtronic offices in Minneapolis.\n\nThe study, presented in Chicago at the American Heart Association meeting, was in part sponsored by device maker Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. But it would appear to apply to such devices also made by competitors Boston Scientific Corp. and St. Jude Medical Inc.\n\nThe study's findings \"are indeed breathtaking,\" said prominent cardiologist Arthur J. Moss of the University of Rochester, in an editorial published online Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The New England Journal also is publishing the study, which included 1,798 patients in Canada, Europe and Turkey.\n\nWhile apparently definitive, the study raised questions about who will be willing to pay for such devices. The devices cost up to $35,000, versus the roughly $25,000 cost of a standard defibrillator. Hospital and doctor fees can raise the total cost over $50,000.\n\n\"How is this going to get funded, and who's going to pay for it?\" asked Eric J. Topol, cardiologist and chief academic officer at Scripps Health in LaJolla, Calif. However, he noted that the reduced rate of hospitalizations in the study \"may actually present a net reduction in costs from a societal standpoint.\"\n\nThe research could provide a boost for the heart-rhythm device business, whose sales have flattened in recent years, although the increased cost is one factor that might limit such a sales increase.\n\nAnother consideration Dr. Topol mentioned is an increase in immediate \"adverse events\" noted in the research, such as the dislodgement of the wire, or \"lead,\" connecting to the heart.\n\nOverall in this study, mild-to-moderate-symptom patients had a 25% relative reduction in death or heart-failure hospitalization with the pacemaker-defibrillators, compared with a standard defibrillator. (This was also a 7.1 percentage point \"absolute\" reduction in death and hospitalization\u201433.2% compared with 40.3%.) But it was the 29% reduction in deaths among the mild-symptom patients that many cardiologists focused on.\n\nHeart-failure specialists said the improvement appears to stem from a phenomenon called remodeling. This means that the device actually makes the otherwise-enlarged and weakened heart smaller and stronger.\n\nWilliam T. Abraham, chief of cardiology at Ohio State University, said that with the lowered death rate, the devices will gain increased adoption despite the cost. \"There will be no way to keep the floodgates closed,\" he said. Dr. Abraham headed Medtronic's first study of such devices a decade ago.\n\nIt's estimated that 22 million people world-wide have heart failure, a reduced pumping capacity of the heart that can lead to severe shortness of breath and frequent hospitalization. Of these, six million are in the U.S., and the cost of the disease in this country is about $40 billion.\n\nOne reason for the high cost is that such patients can quickly wind up in the emergency room and hospitalized after a slight change in diet leads to fluid buildup in the lungs. Patients with reduced heart capacity tend to have fluid build up in their bodies.\n\nThe complex pacemaker-defibrillator causes the heart's chambers to beat in a more coordinated fashion. Like a standard defibrillator, it can also \"defibrillate\" the heart, or administer a sharp shock to stop a lethal heart rhythm.\n\nJust over a month ago, Boston Scientific won federal approval to treat mild-symptom heart-failure patients with such devices. Medtronic is seeking such approval, but already sells it for more severe heart failure patients.\n\nBut the study showed an increase in the number of device- or implantation-related complications within 30 days of implant: 118 among 888 patients with the new device, compared to 61 of 898 in the standard defibrillator group.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Anthony S.L. Tang of the University of Ottawa and the University of British Columbia, explained this is partly because there are more wires, or \"leads,\" in the body with the more complex device than with a standard defibrillator.\n\nWrite to Thomas M.
