Called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the lung ailment has forced 54-year-old Calick to use steroids and a rescue inhaler daily.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get up and walk 10 or 15 feet to go to the bathroom without wheezing,\u201d Calick, of West Hempstead, New York, told FoxNews.com.\n\nCalick\u2019s medications helped manage COPD, but anytime she stopped taking them, her symptoms would return.\n\nAs Calick ran out of options, she sought help from Dr. David Borenstein in New York City. Borenstein, an integrative medicine physician, is one of numerous doctors in the world who is using stem cell therapy to treat various diseases.\n\nStem cells, which can self-renew and replace damaged areas of the body, have been used in the treatment of orthopedic, cardio, autoimmune, neurological\u2014 and pulmonary disorders, like Calick\u2019s.\n\nFor the procedure, Borenstein draws fat cells from the patient\u2019s buttocks or midsection during liposuction, and then separates the stem cells in a centrifuge. Next, stem cells are mixed in a solution, which is administered through an IV and put into a nebulizer, from which the patient inhales them.\n\n\"The ideal candidate for this procedure is someone with an early-stage [form of] COPD, so we can halt the progression of the disease,\u201d Borenstein told FoxNews.com.\n\nBorenstein said about two-thirds of his patients see COPD relief within several weeks to about five months, and that those results last for about a year.\n\nAlthough Borenstein\u2019s stem cell treatments for COPD isn\u2019t approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or covered by health insurance, Calick said the procedure\u2014 which costs less than $8,000\u2014 was well worth the price.\n\n\"I could walk further, I'm not wheezing , I could go out with different friends, stand for long periods of time, walk places,\u201d Calick said of her condition after the stem cell therapy. \u201c[If] someone says, \u2018Oh, you're using the elevator,\u2019 [I say], \u2018No, I\u2019m using the stairs!\u201d\n\nFor more information on stem cell therapy for COPD treatment, visit David Borenstein\u2019s website.", "images":
