It\u2019s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain.\n\n\u201cAll stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,\u201d said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device.\n\n\u201cWe worked on stimulation at a far away location, which makes the treatment more convenient and more discrete so people can use it even during working hours without anyone noticing,\u201d Yarnitsky added by email.\n\nThe study involved 71 people with episodic migraines who had two to eight attacks a month and had not taken drugs to prevent the episodes for at least two months.\n\nParticipants were typically in their mid-to-late 40s and had been experiencing about five migraines a month. Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what\u2019s known as aura\n\nOverall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.\n\nResearchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.\n\nFor the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.\n\nThe four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.\n\nWhen researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nAt the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. So did 24 percent of people in the placebo group.\n\nThe timing of treatment also mattered.\n\nPeople who started using the device within 20 minutes of the start of a migraine reported average pain reductions of 47 percent, compared to a 25 percent reduction in pain for people starting the device later.\n\nEven though the study\u2019s participants were not told whether they were assigned active or placebo treatment, one limitation of the experiment is that participants often stopped placebo treatments before the recommended 20-minute course of stimulation was done, the authors note in Neurology.\n\nThe technology known as transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) that was tested in the current study has been examined in other devices for migraine pain for decades, said Dr. Jean Schoenen, a neurology researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium who wasn\u2019t involved in the current experiment.\n\nOne shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn\u2019t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.\n\n\u201cRapid and sustained relief is what patients want,\u201d Schoenen added.\n\nIf the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can\u2019t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don\u2019t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.\n\n\u201cThe percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,\u201d Schoenen cautioned.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2lsKXgQ Neurology, online March 1, 2017.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Rapaport", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-migraine-electric-stimulation-idUSKBN1685PG", "title": "Mild electric shocks on the arm might help ease migraine pain", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;electric-slug;companies-mrch;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "(Reuters Health) -
