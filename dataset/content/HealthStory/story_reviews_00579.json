When the mothers\u2019 DNA was reanalyzed, researchers said, the anomalies were linked to cancer in each of the women.\n\nResearchers said the report, presented Monday at a meeting of the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis in Washington, D.C., underscores both challenges and opportunities for the tests, which have altered the prenatal testing landscape since they first hit the market in 2011.\n\nRelated JAMA study\n\nThe noninvasive prenatal blood tests can detect evidence of fetal abnormalities in the blood of a pregnant woman. That enables doctors to determine whether a fetus is at risk for such genetic abnormalities as Down syndrome with a blood test rather than with more invasive amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling that can, in rare cases, induce miscarriages.\n\nBut as the new study shows, the unique ability to analyze both maternal and fetal DNA at the same time can lead to surprising results. \u201cWhen the test first came out we didn\u2019t think about cancer being a possibility,\u201d said Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, Boston. \u201cI\u2019ve been working in this field for 25 years, and it\u2019s something that we never expected to find.\u201d\n\nDr. Bianchi is lead author of the study, which was also published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWhile the noninvasive tests are considered highly accurate, Dr. Bianchi said the new findings underscore the need to have any positive result confirmed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling diagnostic test before considering whether to terminate a pregnancy or to plan for a child with developmental disabilities.\n\n\u201cMost of the time, the results do confirm the screening test,\u201d she said, but it is possible the initial result \u201cmay have nothing to do with the fetus.\u201d\n\nThe tests are recommended only for women considered at high risk of carrying fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities, but they have been rapidly adopted by clinicians and patients. Since they first came on the market in 2011, more than 2 million tests have been performed world-wide, Dr. Bianchi said.\n\nLeading marketers of the tests are Illumina Inc., which funded the study, and Sequenom Inc., both in San Diego.\n\nThe eight cases in the study came from a database of more than 125,000 blood samples submitted to Illumina between 2012 and 2014, of which 3,757, or 3%, were positive for at least one chromosomal abnormality associated with Down syndrome and other conditions. Among the very small number of instances where follow-up tests showed the fetus was normal, doctors later reported 10 cases of cancer.\n\nAmong the eight women studied, three had their cancers diagnosed because of the abnormal findings. \u201cThese women said they feel like their babies saved their lives because that was the finding that prompted the additional workup and treatment,\u201d Dr. Bianchi said.\n\nUnanticipated results from genetic tests, known as incidental findings, are the subject of ongoing debate among genetics experts and clinicians about the ethics of whether and how to divulge such information to patients. For instance, if a genetic test for a childhood disease turned up evidence of an elevated risk for breast cancer later in life, there is no consensus on when or how to inform the patient.\n\nIn the case of maternal cancer, \u201cthis is a very interesting incidental finding because it\u2019s something that potentially you need to take immediate action about,\u201d Dr. Bianchi said.\n\nThe full implications of the new findings need further study, said Roberto Romero, a perinatology researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues in an editorial accompanying the study. With the growing popularity of the noninvasive tests, there is increased need \u201cto provide informed advice to potentially affected pregnant women\u201d and to help guide their care, they said.\n\nWrite to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com", "images": ["https://content-thumbnail.cxpublic.com/content/dominantthumbnail/fddd6d28f0576a5772474e644a95623747e1cb4b.jpg?5dc9ac40",
