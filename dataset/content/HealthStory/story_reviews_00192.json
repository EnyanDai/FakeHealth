There, they received a coupon for the latest in fertility management: a genetic test marketed as a way to help maximize their chances of becoming pregnant.\n\nThe hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there\u2019s no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. And even the company\u2019s founder and CEO acknowledges the test can\u2019t provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they\u2019re struggling with infertility.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Fertilome test hit the market at the start of this year and the company behind it, Celmatix, said more than 50 doctors have already ordered it for hundreds of women seeking scientific guidance on questions such as whether they should freeze their eggs for future use, or whether it\u2019s worth it to try another round of in vitro fertilization. The Celmatix CEO, Piraye Yurttas Beim, said her team has heard of a small wave of \u201cFertilome babies\u201d on the way.\n\nSome reproductive specialists are enthusiastic. But others caution that Fertilome is just the latest genetic test promising more than it can deliver \u2014 and, in this case, playing to the fears of women who are anxious about becoming a mother. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.)\n\nThe Fertilome test, which must be ordered by a doctor, analyzes a woman\u2019s DNA for 49 genetic variants that have been linked to various conditions that can sometimes cause fertility problems. A couple weeks later, the doctor gets back a long report listing the odds that a patient has certain conditions.\n\nFor example, she might be 4.4 times more likely than women without a particular genetic variant to have a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by irregular periods and diminished fertility before age 40.\n\nThat sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who\u2019s planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare \u2014 affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 \u2014 so the absolute risk is still very small.\n\nThe $950 Fertilome test must be ordered by a doctor and requires women to get their blood drawn. Celmatix\n\nAnd just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn\u2019t mean they actually have it.\n\nMany of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn\u2019t explain the prevalence.\n\nSo a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages. But the report doesn\u2019t note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The doctor ordering the test, or a genetic counselor, is supposed to provide that information.\n\nWithout the proper context, \u201csome of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients,\u201d said Dr. John Petrozza, chief of the division of reproductive medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nPetrozza said he worries that women might wrongly interpret a long litany of genetic risks to mean that their hopes to start a family are \u201cdoomed.\u201d He also said he sees the test as \u201cvery costly for what it\u2019s trying to do \u2014 and not really giving, at least at this point, what I would consider meaningful information.\u201d\n\nTapping into women\u2019s anxieties\n\nThe Fertilome test was eight years in the making. It draws on more than 5,000 studies that have found associations between particular genetic variants and conditions that can cause fertility problems, company spokeswoman Colleen McMillen said.\n\nBeim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing \u201ctremendous\u201d value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a \u201ctiebreaker\u201d to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize.\n\n\u201cIt will help save a lot of heartache and time if we could know from the very beginning that [a given patient] is at risk for a uterine factor, or if it\u2019s more her eggs,\u201d said Dr. Angie Beltsos, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in Chicago who ordered the Fertilome test for one of her patients for the first time last month.\n\nWhat the test can\u2019t do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. Nor can it tell patients whether they\u2019re wired to get pregnant from IVF \u2014 or wired to fail it. \u201cWe\u2019re not there. We\u2019re not claiming we\u2019re there,\u201d Beim said.\n\nBeim trained as a molecular genetics researcher. As a Ph.D. student at Weill Cornell in the 2000s, she worked on an early project in what\u2019s now called precision medicine: identifying the specific genetic alterations in the tumors of lung cancer patients that seemed to predict whether they would respond to a certain drug.\n\nAfter shifting her research focus to embryology, Beim found herself frustrated that the fertility field wasn\u2019t benefiting from the same boom in translational genetics that was reshaping oncology. So she started her own company.\n\nCelmatix also sells software, called Polaris, that pulls from the medical histories of hundreds of thousands of women to try to predict which fertility treatments are likely to work in different circumstances.\n\n\u201cSome of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients.\u201d Dr. John Petrozza, fertility specialist\n\nFertilome \u2014 not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name \u2014 launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don\u2019t cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half.\n\nCelmatix is mostly marketing the test to reproductive specialists, who are largely using it in the toughest infertility cases, Beim said.\n\nBut the company is also beginning to market directly to women \u2014 including younger women who aren\u2019t trying to get pregnant yet.\n\nThe company has recently started promoting social media ads, like one that asks: \u201cAre you getting the right fertility treatments for your DNA?\u201d Another asserts: \u201cOver 60% of millennial women are open to #eggfreezing. The Fertilome test can help you decide if it is right for you.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s website also features testimonials from women who say they have used Fertilome to help guide their decisions. There\u2019s Ella, a 30-year-old with dark hair and stylish clothing who decided to freeze her eggs after taking the Fertilome test. Then there\u2019s Maxine, a 27-year-old medical school graduate with short hair and a warm smile who used the test to help her juggle the timing of starting a family and starting her career.\n\nThe wrinkle: The images of Ella and Maxine are actually stock photos, available for purchase online.\n\nAfter questions from STAT, the company added a disclaimer acknowledging that testimonials are not quite as they were promoted from the start: the names, images, and details of patients\u2019 stories have been changed to safeguard their privacy.\n\nAlong with its social media outreach, Celmatix has held several after-work events for New York City-area women. It hosted one, on a Wednesday night in April, in its offices on Wall Street.\n\nAn ad beckons women to a seminar to learn about \u201cproactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.\u201d\n\nAnd on a Tuesday evening earlier this summer, the company partnered with a women\u2019s group to host a conversation about \u201cproactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals.\u201d Appetizers, wine, and beer were served \u2014 and, in a gesture to the crowd full of women with pregnancy on their minds, non-alcoholic beverages were on the menu, too.\n\nThe company is also trying to reach OB-GYNs whose patients aren\u2019t yet trying to get pregnant \u2014 or may be just beginning to try. Celmatix held webinars earlier this summer for OB-GYNs, telling them that the test could help \u201coptimize management plans from the very start.\u201d\n\nDNA analysis points a patient to Walmart for supplements\n\nDr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who\u2019ve been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. She\u2019s been ordering the Fertilome test for her patients about five times a week.\n\nEyvazzadeh said the test recently helped her counsel a patient to forgo a third round of IVF, because the patient had a genetic profile that suggested it would be unlikely to work and wasn\u2019t in a financial position to gamble on such slim odds. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) That patient is now considering an egg donor.\n\nAnother one of Eyvazzadeh\u2019s patients is 31-year-old Tara Smith.\n\nTara Smith and her husband, Nick, have spent the past four years trying to conceive. Courtesy Tara Smith\n\nFor Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there\u2019s nothing more important than family. She\u2019s dreamed of having her own baby since she was a child herself.\n\nThat\u2019s why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. They\u2019ve seen doctors in St. Louis and Las Vegas, taken countless blood tests, and tried two rounds of IVF and several cycles of intrauterine insemination. Smith has long known that she has a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which can make it harder to get pregnant, but no one could figure out exactly why none of the treatments were working.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gut-wrenching. You\u2019re almost like this alien,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNobody knows what\u2019s going on, and you can\u2019t fix the problem.\u201d\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day.

Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nSo when Eyvazzadeh suggested that she take the Fertilome test, Smith jumped at the possibility of finally getting answers. Eyvazzadeh walked her through the results last month before showing her the report, so Smith had an idea of what to expect. Still, Smith said, \u201cmy heart sank\u201d when she saw her results for the first time.\n\nShe was 2.88 times more likely to have endometriosis, a painful disorder of the uterus, than a woman without a certain genetic variant. She was 1.54 times more likely to have primary ovarian insufficiency. She also carried three genetic variants that elevated her risk of having recurrent pregnancy loss. And she had 24 additional genetic variants that are more weakly associated with various conditions that can play a role in fertility problems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gut-wrenching. You\u2019re almost like this alien. Nobody knows what\u2019s going on, and you can\u2019t fix the problem.\u201d Tara Smith, fertility patient\n\nDespite it all, Eyvazzadeh had a plan. Because many of Smith\u2019s genetic variants were involved in immune response regulation, she instructed Smith to focus on minimizing inflammation.\n\nAt Eyvazzadeh\u2019s recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart. Smith also embarked on a new diet, cutting out dairy and red meat. (A 2015 review of the evidence on the optimal diet to promote fertility \u2014 and the utility of supplements \u2014 found the data \u201cconflicting.\u201d)\n\nThey also plan to have Smith get infusions of intralipids \u2014 a cocktail of soy bean oil, egg yolks, and other fatty acids \u2014 during her third round of IVF, which she\u2019s embarking on now. (Intralipid infusions are increasingly popular, but the practice was found not to help in a 2016 study of older women with a history of miscarriage.)\n\nSmith has mostly positive feelings about her Fertilome test. Having a concrete plan based on what\u2019s in her DNA gives her a new sense of hope. \u201cNow I feel like we\u2019re armed with information,\u201d she said. But at the same time, she said, knowing what may be wrong with her makes her apprehensive about whether she\u2019ll ever get pregnant.\n\nAfter all, so far, the test has pointed her only to try nutritional tweaks of uncertain value. It doesn\u2019t offer any definitive answers.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what gives Dr. Valerie Baker pause. A reproductive endocrinologist at Stanford, she recently suggested the test to a patient with longstanding infertility. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Baker recalled responding. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t do anything differently.\u201d\n\nShe did not end up ordering the test.", "images": ["https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Newsletter-Logo-Images-DR.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/themes/stat/images/stat-logo.svg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/plugins/stat-lazy-load/images/330x400-00000000.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AP106886737-1024x576.jpg", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/NickTaraHandout-640x787.jpg", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=46858&fmt=gif", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Circular_Rebecca.png", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/FertilomeBox-640x555.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=436331036555416&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AP106886737-645x645.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AP106886737-1024x576.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Robbins", "Adam Feuerstein", "Jonathan Saltzman", "Boston Globe", "Ed Silverman", "Andrew Joseph"], "canonical_link": "https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/02/infertility-genetic-test-fertilome/", "title": "Can a genetic test really boost your odds of becoming pregnant?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "origin", "description": "A $950 DNA test is marketed as a way to maximize women's chances of becoming pregnant.
