Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could slim down without so much effort?\n\nAnyone looking for a shortcut to weight loss might be tempted to try one of many supplements that claim to burn fat and boost metabolism. These products often contain a not-especially-exotic ingredient that\u2019s already a staple of the American lifestyle: caffeine.\n\nThe morning coffee drinkers at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts notwithstanding, caffeine has a strong reputation as a weight-loss aid. The stimulant is one of the key ingredients of Zantrex-3, the popular weight-loss supplement from Zoller Laboratories, based in Salt Lake City. The company claims each capsule contains \u201cup to\u201d 160 milligrams of \u201ccaffeine and caffeine-like stimulants\u201d (from green tea and yerba mate, among other sources), while a government database of supplements says each capsule of Zantrex-3 contains more than 160 mg of caffeine. That\u2019s slightly more than you\u2019d get from a typical double shot of espresso. Other ingredients include ginseng and damiana, a Latin American herb traditionally used as an aphrodisiac.\n\nUsers are instructed to take two capsules with a glass of water before a meal or anytime during the day when they need an energy boost. According to the label, they shouldn\u2019t take more than six capsules in a day. Zantrex-3 is available at many drugstores. You can expect to pay about $20 for a package of 30 capsules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLipoFuze, a weight-loss supplement from E Nutrition Research, based in Orem, Utah, also packs a significant amount of caffeine. The label says that each capsule contains 200 mg of a green tea extract that is 50% caffeine. Other ingredients include vitamin D, chromium and coenzyme Q10.\n\nUsers are instructed to take two capsules a day. A package of 60, a one-month\u2019s supply, costs about $50.\n\nThe claims\n\nThe website for Zantrex-3 says it provides both extreme energy and rapid weight loss \u2014 \u201c546% more weight loss than the leading ephedra-based diet pill,\u201d to be exact. The site features a picture of reality TV star (and official product endorser) Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi of \u201cJersey Shore\u201d pulling a bottle of the pills out of her purse. (The website calls her a \u201ccelebrity,\u201d and, yes, the term is in quotation marks.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmy Heaton, director of scientific affairs for Zoller, says that caffeine and caffeine-like compounds have been proved to improve energy, stamina, concentration, mood and metabolism. But, she says, \u201cthey have not been shown to significantly increase weight loss.\u201d\n\nHeaton adds that \u201cit\u2019s not just about weight loss. It\u2019s about fat loss and increased energy.\u201d To drive home the message, she points to Snooki\u2019s transformation \u201cfrom a self-professed meatball to a sexy and slim fireball.\u201d\n\nThe website for LipoFuze says that the supplement \u201cincreases the metabolic mechanism in your body.\u201d The site also says the green tea and caffeine will \u201crev up your metabolism\u201d and \u201cincrease energy, focus and physical performance.\u201d The site features testimonials it says are from users who claim they have lost huge amounts of weight with the help of LipoFuze. One man says he dropped more than 100 pounds, although it\u2019s unclear how long that took. A woman says she lost 40 pounds in less than a year, including 20 pounds in her first month.\n\nAttempts to reach E Nutrition Research for comment were not successful.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nCaffeine shows up in a lot of weight-loss products, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be any sort of silver bullet against flab, says C. Michael White, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. White says that, to his knowledge, there are no well-designed studies showing that caffeine works better than a placebo when it comes to weight loss.\n\nWhite notes that caffeine is a diuretic, which means that people taking large doses might shed some weight through water loss, but that\u2019s not the kind of slimming most users are looking for.\n\nAs reported in a 2010 issue of the International Journal of Obesity, caffeine may in fact be able to increase a person\u2019s metabolic rate by 4% or 5%. But, according to White, there\u2019s no clear evidence that this translates into actual weight loss. One possible explanation: Any increase in metabolism might go hand-in-hand with a boost in appetite, he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCaffeine does seem to enhance the weight-loss powers of some other ingredients, White says. For example, green tea contains antioxidants that encourage cells to burn extra calories, and caffeinated green tea seems to promote more weight loss than decaf versions. But even this combination yields very modest results. \u201cIn clinical trials, the weight loss is 2.5 to 4 pounds, not 40 pounds,\u201d White says.\n\nGerald Endress, the fitness director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C., says patients often ask about caffeine as a weight-loss aid. \u201cI tell them it\u2019s definitely not going to be as helpful as 30 minutes of exercise.\u201d\n\nEndress says a little caffeine before a workout might help a person exercise harder and longer, which could theoretically help them control their weight. But the real credit would go to the exercise, not the caffeine.\n\nEndress also warns that too much caffeine \u2014 such as the high doses found in Zantrex \u2014 could cause jitteriness, anxiety, spikes in blood pressure and rapid heartbeats in some people.\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?
