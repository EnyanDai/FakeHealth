He sounded so miserable that afternoon that Mrs. Ryan, distraught, remembers pausing to feel sorry for the doctor.\n\nControlled trials have for decades been considered essential for proving a drug\u2019s value before it can go to market. But the continuing trial of the melanoma drug, PLX4032, has ignited an anguished debate among oncologists about whether a controlled trial that measures a drug\u2019s impact on extending life is still the best method for evaluating hundreds of genetically targeted cancer drugs being developed.\n\nDefenders of controlled trials say they are crucial in determining whether a drug really does extend life more than competing treatments. Without the hard proof the trials can provide, doctors are left to prescribe unsubstantiated hope \u2014 and an overstretched health care system is left to pay for it. In melanoma, in particular, no drug that looked promising in early trials had ever turned out to prolong lives.\n\nPLX4032 shrinks tumors in the right patients, for a limited time. But would those who took it live longer? No one knew for sure.\n\n\u201cI think we have to prove it,\u201d said Dr. Paul B. Chapman, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center who is leading the trial. \u201cI think we have to show that we\u2019re actually helping people in the long run.\u201d\n\nBut critics of the trials argue that the new science behind the drugs has eclipsed the old rules \u2014 and ethics \u2014 of testing them. They say that in some cases, drugs under development, PLX4032 among them, may be so much more effective than their predecessors that putting half the potential beneficiaries into a control group, and delaying access to the drug to thousands of other patients, causes needless suffering.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWith chemotherapy, you\u2019re subjecting patients to a toxic treatment, and the response rates are much lower, so it\u2019s important to answer \u2018Are you really helping the patient?\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Charles L. Sawyers, chairman of human oncology at Sloan-Kettering. \u201cBut with these drugs that have minimal side effects and dramatic response rates, where we understand the biology, I wonder, why do we have to be so rigorous? This could be one of those defining cases that says, \u2018Look, our system has to change.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDr. Richard Pazdur, director of the cancer drug office at the Food and Drug Administration, said in a recent interview that the new wave of drugs in development \u2014 especially for intractable cancers like melanoma \u2014 might require individual evaluation. \u201cThis is an unprecedented situation that will, hopefully, be increasingly common, and it may require a regulatory flexibility and an open public discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd doctors say that for them, the new wave of cancer drugs is intensifying the conflict between their responsibility to their patients and their commitment to gathering scientific knowledge for generations of the critically ill.\n\nOf course, no single pair of patients can fairly represent the outcomes of a trial whose results are not yet known. Rather, the story of Thomas McLaughlin and Brandon Ryan is one of entwined paths that suddenly diverged, with a roll of the dice.\n\nAt times beseeching and belligerent, Mr. McLaughlin argued his cousin\u2019s case to get the new drug with anyone he could find at U.C.L.A. \u201cHey, put him on it, he needs it,\u201d he pleaded. And then: \u201cWho the hell is making these decisions?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nHe believed he should trade places on the trial with Mr. Ryan, who was pursuing his contractor\u2019s license and had just bought a four-bedroom home in Bakersfield. \u201cBrandon has everything going for him,\u201d he told his Aunt Jan.\n\nBut Mr. Ryan told his mother he was glad that Mr. McLaughlin, who has a young son and daughter, was the one getting the promising drug. \u201cTommy has the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need him around.\u201d\n\nPath to a Second Trial\n\nThe debate over the controlled testing of PLX4032 began in June 2009, around the time Mr. McLaughlin awakened with what felt like an explosion under his right armpit.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe drug, manufactured by Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, was designed for melanoma patients whose tumors carry a particular mutation, and the company reported that month that nearly all 32 such patients in the drug\u2019s first clinical trial, called Phase 1, had seen their tumors shrink.\n\nThe reprieve was all too brief: most saw their tumors begin to grow again within the year. Still, The New England Journal of Medicine called the drug \u201ca major breakthrough\u201d for people with advanced melanoma, whose median survival is eight months after diagnosis. A second, or Phase 2, trial, aiming to validate the results in more patients, was already in the works. And in meetings that summer, several oncologists urged Roche to seek accelerated approval from the F.D.A. The agency allows a manufacturer to sell a drug based on early promise so long as it proceeds with the traditional controlled trial comparing it with the standard treatment.\n\nBut with patients already begging doctors for the drug, it seemed unlikely that anyone would join a trial with only a 50-50 chance of getting PLX4032 once it was already on the market. Unless the trial was conducted before approval, it seemed, there would be no chance to get definitive data on its effectiveness.\n\nSome melanoma specialists familiar with the drug would have traded the data for faster access to the drug. \u201cI know all that I need to know based on the results we already have,\u201d said Dr. Keith Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the early clinical testing. \u201cMy use of this drug is not going to be informed by testing it against a drug we all hate and would rather never give a dose of again in our lives.\u201d\n\nThe standard chemotherapy used in melanoma, dacarbazine, slowed tumor growth in 15 percent of patients for an average of two months. By contrast, PLX4032 had halted tumor growth in 81 percent of patients for an average of eight.\n\nIt was conceivable that when the cancer started up again, it would progress much faster in patients who had taken the new drug, wiping out any extra time they might have gained. But even if so, many doctors believed that if the drug provided relief by shrinking tumors \u2014 like the one Mr. McLaughlin soon learned was pressing against a nerve in his arm \u2014 that would improve their patients\u2019 lives.\n\nThe trial, moreover, would cost $100 million and delay the possibility of F.D.A. approval by at least two years. To some doctors, it seemed a waste of time and resources that would be better used for trials testing what everyone most cared about: how to prolong the remissions.\n\nThere was reason to believe that combining PLX4032 with other drugs \u2014 some from competitors \u2014 would make it more effective. But researchers had to rely on Roche for permission until the drug was available for sale, and the company had not been forthcoming.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Chapman of Sloan-Kettering came up with a new tack: an unconventional bid to speed the drug\u2019s approval, rooted in the observation that patients weeks or days from death could get out of bed and off oxygen when given PLX4032, sometimes for months. The doctors working with the drug referred to this as the Lazarus effect; it was unheard of with dacarbazine.\n\nA trial that cataloged PLX4032\u2019s effect on the well-being of the sickest patients, Dr. Chapman argued, would probably yield fast, tangible results. For him, it represented a chance to give patients symptomatic relief, even if the drug turned out not to prolong life.\n\n\u201cEven without a survival benefit, maybe we could show that it helps people,\u201d he urged. \u201cIf you could get Aunt Sadie to the wedding and off of oxygen, that would be great.\u201d\n\nBut company officials feared that might lead to approval for only a narrow group of the sickest patients. The surest way to get the F.D.A\u2019s endorsement for a broader market was a controlled trial. And with its competitors rushing to get similar drugs to market, the findings of such a trial might give Roche an advantage in marketing its version as the only one proven to prolong survival.\n\nOn Sept. 1 last year, the company submitted its plan to the F.D.A. for the traditional, randomized, controlled trial of PLX4032. It would involve 680 patients, half of them in a control group. Dr. Chapman would be the lead investigator for more than 100 sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. Because of the different ways the drugs were dispensed \u2014 one by mouth and one by infusions \u2014 doctors and patients, it was decided, would both know who got which drug.\n\nThe following week was when Mr. Ryan learned that his cousin might have a health problem. He called Mr. McLaughlin from a job site in Colorado, to tell him about his new Dodge Ram, a truck he knew Mr. McLaughlin had long coveted.\n\nPhoto\n\nHe invited Mr. McLaughlin to come stay with him: there was plenty of welding work, and he could help break in the truck. But Mr. McLaughlin, who had no health insurance, had finally visited a doctor about the pain under his arm. It was melanoma, and he would need surgery to remove some lymph nodes.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, suddenly silent. \u201cYou have cancer?\u201d\n\nTwo Men\u2019s Struggles\n\nMr. McLaughlin\u2019s surgery, it seemed, had come too late. In the weeks following, small tumors popped up across his body, including one on his collarbone and one on his triceps.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Mr. Ryan discovered a swollen node under his own right armpit in October, his mother was not taking any chances. She begged him to go to the emergency room in Colorado. Even so, when the verdict was melanoma, both families were shocked.\n\nWas it genes? Their mothers, after all, were sisters. But there was no history of cancer in the family.\n\nEnvironment? The boys had fought, played and competed with each other since childhood: who could hold his breath the longest, do the highest cannonball dive, suck down a Slurpee fastest, win their grandfather\u2019s approval? They had ranged across California on iron-working jobs, eating the same food, drinking the same large quantities of beer, promising, in a rare moment of seriousness, that each would bury the other with his hardhat when the moment came. Coincidence?\n\nCompared with most cancers, melanoma strikes a disproportionate number of young people; it is the sixth most common cancer in the United States.\n\nThere was no way to know.\n\nLast Thanksgiving, Mr. McLaughlin greeted Mr. Ryan with the usual bear hug. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re doing this together,\u201d he said.\n\nNot ones for excessively talking things over, they left it at that.\n\nYet both cousins, like the other family members, believed then that Mr. Ryan stood a far better chance of surviving the disease than his cousin. His cancer was rated Stage 3, with no evidence yet that it had spread to distant parts of his body. Mr. McLaughlin, at Stage 4, had a tumor ominously near his liver. And Mr. Ryan had health insurance, while Mr. McLaughlin had none.\n\nIt was the mutated gene that the U.C.L.A doctor found in Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s cancer cells in December that turned his luck around. Called B-RAF, it goes awry in half of the 68,000 Americans who develop melanoma each year, for reasons not well understood, signaling cells to grow uncontrollably.\n\nThe mutation meant that he would be eligible for PLX4032\u2019s new trial, so the cost of the drug and doctors\u2019 visits would be paid by Roche. And it turned out he would get the pills even before the controlled study began, on a small test of the drug\u2019s interaction with common drugs like caffeine and cough syrup. Judging by the response of patients to PLX4032 in the first trial, Mr. McLaughlin was almost certain to respond. But the medication, the doctors at U.C.L.A warned him, might cause a rash and fatigue and would probably make his skin extremely sensitive to the sun.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThey told me to get a job where I could be inside all the time,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin told Mr. Ryan with a grin; perhaps no one else could better understand how ridiculous it seemed for someone who had spent his whole life outdoors.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But because he had few symptoms, it hardly seemed to matter. After surgery to remove his cancerous lymph nodes and radiation, he was preparing to return to work.\n\n\u201cDude, I had ALL of my lymph nodes out,\u201d Mr. Ryan boasted to his cousin over a Mexican-style Christmas dinner at their grandmother\u2019s home in Santa Maria, not passing up an opportunity at one-upmanship. \u201cHow many did you have out again, 11?\u201d\n\nMr. McLaughlin, fingering the tumor that felt like a knot under his arm, might not have been in top form that evening. But he mustered a scoffing reply: \u201cSo you had all of them taken out and only four had tumors?\u201d\n\nThe following week, he took his first pills.\n\nBut even as the tumor on Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s collarbone began to melt away, a faint spot on Mr. Ryan\u2019s lung began to grow.\n\nA Life-or-Death Debate\n\nThe discontent among some oncologists over the design of the PLX4032 trial spilled over at a scientific meeting sponsored by the Melanoma Research Alliance in late February.\n\nThe ethical review boards at dozens of prestigious cancer research institutions had signed off on the trial, and the leading melanoma oncologists had embraced it: after all, it was the only way to get the most promising drug available for their patients.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut with the trial now under way, a few attending the Las Vegas meeting had already had to tell patients they had been assigned to the trial\u2019s chemotherapy control group. And some had begun to question whether an ethical code that calls for doctors to be genuinely uncertain about which of a trial\u2019s treatments will be more effective had been breached when it came to PLX4032 versus dacarbazine.\n\nAfter Dr. Chapman presented the recent data from the drug\u2019s promising first trial to a packed room, Dr. Neal Rosen, a friend and Sloan-Kettering colleague, stood up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Dr. Rosen said with unusual formality. \u201cBut if it was your life on the line, Doctor, would you take dacarbazine?\u201d\n\nThe room was silent.\n\n\u201cMy goal,\u201d Dr. Chapman shot back, \u201cis to find out as quickly as possible in as few patients as possible whether this works. If we never know, then we\u2019re never going to be able to build on anything.\u201d\n\nOne of the melanoma field\u2019s senior clinicians, Dr. Chapman had lived through trial after trial of drugs that failed to live up to early promise. Almost every oncologist knew, too, of a case nearly 20 years earlier when bone marrow transplants appeared so effective that breast cancer patients demanded their immediate approval, only to learn through a controlled trial that the transplants were less effective than chemotherapy and in some cases caused death.\n\n\u201cMaking patients\u2019 tumors go away is gratifying,\u201d Dr. Chapman told critics. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the business I\u2019m in. I\u2019m in the business of making people live longer. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d\n\nSeveral of the most veteran melanoma doctors agreed with him. But others argued that oncologists had an ethical obligation to push both the F.D.A. and Roche to make the drug more immediately available.\n\nSome of the strongest criticism came from laboratory researchers who study the biology of the disease and see the drug as fundamentally different from its predecessors. The previous red herrings, they argued, never had such a high response rate. Few other drugs had shrunk tumors in as high a percentage of patients with melanoma or any other solid tumor as PLX4032 had in its first human trial.\n\n\u201cMany of my colleagues who are outstanding clinical investigators have been able to convince themselves that this is a fair thing to do,\u201d Dr. David E. Fisher, a leading melanoma biologist at Massachusetts General, said of the controlled trial. \u201cMy personal view is it\u2019s nuts. I don\u2019t know anyone who hasn\u2019t shuddered at the concept that we can\u2019t let patients on the control arm cross over because we need them to die earlier to prove this point.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, some doctors were searching for other trials that could help patients worsening in the chemotherapy group of the Roche trial, even at the risk of undermining its results. Several lobbied to get such patients slots on a new trial of a PLX4032 competitor, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to tell patients, \u2018We\u2019ll try this for six weeks; if it\u2019s working, great, if not, we\u2019ll shift you right away to the other trial,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey A. Sosman of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019m going to be able to live with the randomization.\u201d\n\nThe reason to prevent patients in the chemotherapy group from subsequently getting PLX4032 was to ensure a clean comparison. But who could prevent them from trying treatments that might well help them live longer? At least one melanoma patient left Sloan-Kettering\u2019s care to join the Glaxo trial at New York University.\n\nIn April, Mr. McLaughlin donned a bandanna, a sun hat, a long-sleeved shirt and pants and went to a job building fences on a nearby ranch. The pills, he had vowed, would not prevent him from working outside.\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s health, by contrast, was declining. He returned from work only to sleep. Often, when his mother called, he was too tired to come to the phone. \u201cSleeping, Mom,\u201d he would text her. Or \u201cYou have no idea what this feels like, Mom.\u201d Or just, \u201cI hurt.\u201d\n\nHis doctor in Bakersfield moved up a scheduled scan.\n\nAt the same time, a debate grew heated over Roche\u2019s decision to withhold PLX4032 from many patients not eligible for the trial because they had already been treated with chemotherapy.\n\nThe F.D.A. regularly approves such programs, known as \u201ccompassionate use,\u201d for promising experimental drugs. But Roche feared a prospective trial candidate might undergo chemotherapy just to qualify for compassionate use and get PLX4032 with no strings attached.\n\nIn an emotional moment, Dr. Donald Lawrence of Massachusetts General Hospital e-mailed colleagues about Roche\u2019s decision last spring, under the subject line \u201cmoral outrage.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cJust had yet another conversation with a [patient] with a B-RAF mutation who will die in the next month or so because he can\u2019t get PLX4032,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI feel we need to muster the support of our patients and lobby both Roche and the F.D.A. Compromising the Phase III trial is not justification for withholding an effective drug from dying patients.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Dr. Michael Atkins, director of the cancer clinical trials office at Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center in Boston, urged him to consider what he thought was the greater good: \u201cEven though it is painful, I think completing a clean Phase III trial and determining if there truly is a survival benefit for PLX would have major value for the field and future patients.\u201d\n\nA Bitter Blow\n\nOn the morning of May 12, Mr. Ryan and his mother drove to U.C.L.A. The cancer had spread throughout his body. Yet that weekend, the family was filled with hope. Dr. Chmielowski had found the same gene mutation that Mr. McLaughlin had in one of Mr. Ryan\u2019s tumors. He was finally eligible for the trial.\n\nBut the computer made its assignment the following Tuesday, making sure that he would not be getting his cousin\u2019s \u201csuperpills.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan\u2019s mother picked up the call while her son was undergoing radiation for the tumor on his spine. He was on oxygen.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dr. Chmielowski repeated as she cried into the phone.\n\nThere must be someone higher up to whom she could talk, she said.\n\nThere was not, he told her. It was completely random. No one could change it.\n\n\u201cWho else has this drug?\u201d Mrs. Ryan demanded. \u201cWe will go wherever we have to go.\u201d\n\nThere was nowhere to go, the doctor explained. Once Mr. Ryan had been randomly assigned to the control group at one place, the other hospitals testing the melanoma drug would not give it to him. U.C.L.A. had turned away such patients, too.\n\nThe doctor did not tell Mrs. Ryan about the Lazarus effect \u2014 that for someone as sick as Mr. Ryan, PLX4032 was probably the best chance to control his symptoms while doctors searched for something better.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe doctor could not know, of course, whether Mr. Ryan really would have fared better on the Roche drug, or whether Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s disease would have been held in check just as well with the chemotherapy. Obeying the trial\u2019s protocol meant withholding the drug from patients like Mr. Ryan, and that, Dr. Chmielowski would later explain, \u201cis awful.\u201d\n\nHe told Mrs. Ryan, if the chemotherapy could stabilize her son for just a month or so, there were two new trials opening that might help him.\n\n\u201cWhat gives them the right to play God?\u201d Mrs. Ryan exploded at home later that night. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to say, \u2018We want you for a statistic\u2019 instead of giving them a chance at life.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan started his infusion the next day. But a week later, he was hospitalized, unable to breathe on his own and in horrible pain.\n\n\u201cBud brownies,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin prescribed when he arrived to visit, having already signed himself up for medical marijuana use. \u201cYou get out of here, and I\u2019ll make them for you.\u201d\n\nHe rated the nurses, trying to make Mr. Ryan laugh.\n\n\u201cMaybe you should just say you want to split some of your pills with her and she\u2019ll hop into bed with you,\u201d he suggested after one left the room. A few minutes later, \u201cNo, that one\u2019s a little cuter.\u201d\n\nThen he reminded his cousin of the time Mr. Ryan had thrown a bolt up to where he was sitting atop a wall for a welding job adjacent to a golf course. Mr. Ryan missed his mark by several feet and the bolt landed on the other side, shattering the windshield of another contractor\u2019s truck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018You just tagged that guy\u2019s freakin\u2019 truck,\u2019 \u201d Mr. McLaughlin recounted for the other family members in the hospital room. On his side of the wall, Mr. Ryan had picked up a stray golf ball. \u201cAnd then the guy walks out and Brandon goes, \u2018Looks like those golfers hit your windshield.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn his hospital bed, Mr. Ryan was beginning to smile.\n\n\u201cAnd the guy gets in the truck,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin finished, \u201cand takes off for the golf course.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, at his cousin\u2019s funeral in mid-June, Mr. McLaughlin placed Mr. Ryan\u2019s hardhat in his coffin and helped carry it to the grave.\n\nMr. McLaughlin has now been taking PLX4032 for nine months. He is awaiting his next CT scan.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/TRIALSIDEBAR/TRIALSIDEBAR-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/19trials4/19trials4-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/19trial1_span/trial-1-articleLarge.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/jpTRIALS3/jpTRIALS3-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/19trial1_span/trial-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/jpTRIALS1/jpTRIALS1-jumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/jpTRIALS2/jpTRIALS2-jumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/us/19trial1_span/trial-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Harmon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/health/research/19trial.html", "title": "New Drugs Stir Debate on Rules of Clinical Trials", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069052764", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/health/research/19trial.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/health/research/19trial.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069052764"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/health/research/19trial.html", "title": "New Drugs Stir Debate on Rules of Clinical Trials", "description": "Two cousins developed the same lethal cancer; only one could take part in an experimental drug trial.
