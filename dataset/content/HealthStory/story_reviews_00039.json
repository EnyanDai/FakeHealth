The cancers had spread across the bodies of each participant, who did not respond to standard treatment.\n\nOver half of patients with ovarian cancer and over a third with lung cancer saw their tumors shrink, according to the study, which was published in the Annals of Oncology.\n\nThe cocktail also stopped the cancer growing for almost six months, which is unexpected for patients with advanced-stage cancers who were unresponsive to currently available treatments, including chemotherapy, the authors said.\n\nRead more: Most common childhood cancer is likely caused by lack of exposure to infections, major study finds\n\nThe research was led by scientists at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, as well as teams in nine institutions across the U.K.\n\nIt built on previous research by the ICR that showed ovarian cancer cells resistant to treatment generally have higher levels of a molecule called p-S6K, which aids the growth of the disease. The scientists hypothesized the cancer could use this molecule to render chemotherapy ineffective.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nVistusertib attacks proteins called mTOR1 and 2, which turn on the p-S6K protein. Combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy, the scientists were able to block cancer cells from harnessing p-S6K. That is why the patients\u2019 tumors shrunk, the study suggests.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDr. Susana Banerjee, consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust and team leader in gynecological cancers at ICR, who is leading the phase II trial, commented in a statement: \u201cEffective treatment options for women with relapsed ovarian cancer are limited, so these results are very encouraging.\n\nCommenting on the next stage of the research, she said: \u201cIn the larger phase II trial we\u2019ve recruited 140 women with relapsed ovarian cancer across the U.K. to standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel) or paclitaxel in combination with vistusertib. We need to wait for these results, expected later this year, to see how effective this approach is compared to chemotherapy alone.\u201d\n\nDr. Dean A. Fennell, professor and consultant in thoracic medical oncology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the study, told Newsweek the study presents an \u201cexciting result.\u201d\n\nHe was particularly surprised by the magnitude of the response triggered by vistusertib combined with paclitaxel, which is closely related to standard chemotherapy.\n\nHowever, Fennell said the study tripped up in that there was no predictive link between mutations and response to treatment. \u201cIn other words, there was no sign of who might benefit the most with treatment,\" he explained.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThis combination of vistusertib and paclitaxel appears promising in lung cancer. Confirmatory studies will be essential and if positive would broaden our armamentarium for fighting this cancer.\u201d", "images":
