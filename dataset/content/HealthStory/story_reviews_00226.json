Increasingly, cancer will no longer be identified, categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits, or in which it first gained its foothold. In a shift that is already underway, cancers will be known by \u2014 and treated for \u2014 the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them.\n\nIn clinical trial evidence cited by the FDA this week, pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about 40% of patients with one of 15 end-stage malignancies. And for 78% of those patients, that response lasted six months or more. A trial reported earlier this year found that in 17 of 30 advanced cancer patients, pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer, and 24 patients were still alive a year after starting the drug.\n\nAll of those subjects, of course, had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments, that record of success constitutes a \u201chome run,\u201d said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Kimmel Cancer Center. Vogelstein\u2019s 1993 research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumab\u2019s broad cancer-fighting powers.\n\nWith the FDA\u2019s announcement, drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians, patients and government regulators think of cancer. No longer will they see all cancers of the lung, breast, colon, brain, liver, pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another. Instead, they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where they\u2019re found. And they\u2019ll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon, either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack.\n\nIt\u2019s a key principle of what\u2019s called \u201cprecision medicine\u201d \u2014 the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumor\u2019s specific molecular fingerprint, and not, as most chemotherapies do, harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones.\n\nIn the cancers pembrolizumab treats, the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern DNA repair. Deficiencies in the DNA\u2019s \u201cmismatch repair system\u201d generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells, and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets. The mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and the FDA had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this week\u2019s FDA approval goes further: It makes clear that the drug\u2019s molecular targets are also common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, and less frequently present in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid gland.\n\nAll told, scientists believe about 4% of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by Keytruda.\n\nThe appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape \u2014 not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well.\n\nOrganizations representing, say, people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients. In cancer centers, specialists in, say, melanoma will start (in fact, have already started) treating patients with a range of other cancers. When drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug, they\u2019ll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than they\u2019ve used in the past: the genetic signatures their tumors bear.\n\nEven before the FDA\u2019s announcement this week, all these processes were underway. The FDA\u2019s decision recognizes that fact, said Dr. Svetomir Markovic, an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in treating melanoma.\n\nBut the decision also puts cancer physicians \u2014 as well as insurers, who will be called on to pay Keytruda\u2019s $100,000-per-year price tag \u2014 on notice that a new era is at hand, said Markovic.\n\n\u201cThe field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed,\u201d he said. Physicians \u201care having a hard time keeping up, and I can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this decision by the FDA is really wonderful: It has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help.\u201d\n\nTwo other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment \u2014 nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) \u2014 but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum. Several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials, and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn many ways we\u2019re at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy: There\u2019s clear benefit but it\u2019s still a minority of patients that get long-term benefit,\u201d said Markovic of the Mayo Institute. \u201cWe will get better at this.\u201d\n\nMarkovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab, as well as the FDA\u2019s new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions, could prompt drug companies, physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs. With a clearer idea of which patients they might help, and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials, some failures may look more promising, he said.\n\n\u201cWe just needed to take the first step in showing that this long-believed theory \u2014 that the immune system can kill cancer \u2014 is true,\u201d Markovic added. \u201cIt indeed can.\u201d\n\nmelissa.healy@latimes.com\n\n@LATMelissaHealy", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11be2d5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fea%2F9488b73ef606926f590a2b30a5b1%2Fla-1495842897-q6odpiglai-snap-image", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd585f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F12%2F57%2Fa343371429b7000ea37eaded8d93%2Fimg-534f3749-turbine-la-bio-melissa-healy", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06d5c24/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+0/resize/840x472!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fea%2F9488b73ef606926f590a2b30a5b1%2Fla-1495842897-q6odpiglai-snap-image"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11be2d5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fea%2F9488b73ef606926f590a2b30a5b1%2Fla-1495842897-q6odpiglai-snap-image", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Melissa Healy Is A Health", "Science Reporter With The Los Angeles Times Writing The Washington", "D.C.", "Area.
