But researchers say the relationship between homocysteine and vitamin B12 levels and Alzheimer's disease risk has been unclear.\n\nThe seven-year study followed 271 Finnish people ages 65 to 79 who did not have any symptoms of Alzheimer's disease at the start of the study.\n\nDuring the study, published in Neurology, 17 people developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Researchers found that each picomolar increase in blood vitamin B12 level was associated with a 2% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease among the elderly.\n\nIn addition, each micromolar increase in blood homocysteine level raised the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 16%.\n\nBlood levels of folate, another nutrient believed to lower homocysteine levels, were not linked to Alzheimer's disease risk.\n\n\u201cOur findings show the need for further research on the role of vitamin B12 as a marker for identifying people who are at increased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d says researcher Babak Hooshmand, MD, MSc, with Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, in a news release. \u201cLow levels of vitamin B12 are surprisingly common in the elderly.\"\n\n\"The few studies that have investigated the usefulness of vitamin B12 supplements to reduce the risk of memory loss have had mixed results,\u201d says Hooshmand.\n\nCommon dietary sources of vitamin B12 include fish, poultry, and meat products.", "images":
