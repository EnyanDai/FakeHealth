Now a new study from Duke University Medical Center and Columbia University may help explain why.\n\nWhen researchers compared patients who had gastric bypass surgery to those who lost the same amount of weight by dieting, they found that the surgery patients had lower levels of amino acids that have been linked to insulin resistance.\n\nThe study was small, including just 10 patients who had the surgery and 11 patients who followed severely calorie-restricted diets. And the patients in both groups had lost just a fraction of the weight they needed to lose at the time of the analysis.\n\nBut researchers say the preliminary findings could one day lead to diabetes treatments.\n\n\u201cCertainly weight loss by any means improves type 2 diabetes, but there is something else going on with gastric bypass surgery,\u201d study researcher Blandine Laferrere, MD, of Columbia University\u2019s St. Luke\u2019s and Roosevelt Hospital Center, tells WebMD.\n\n\u201cSurgery puts the diabetes into remission. Most of the research has focused on changes in gut hormones, but we have shown that a decline in specific circulating amino acids also occurs.\u201d", "images":
