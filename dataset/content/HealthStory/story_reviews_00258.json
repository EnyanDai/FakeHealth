Being around for my daughter, my son, my wife. Yeah it was a really tough time,\u201d he said.\n\nSandoval is alive today because of an experimental form of immunotherapy called CAR-T.\n\nNormally, our immune cells are good at killing invaders like bacteria but bad at fighting cancer. With CAR-T, a patient\u2019s own immune cells are removed from the body, reprogrammed to find and destroy cancer cells, then put back into the bloodstream.\n\nOn Friday, Moffitt Cancer Center and MD Anderson reported test results of 101 patients with advanced lymphoma who had failed previous therapy and were treated with CAR-T.\n\n\u201cIt puts a GPS navigation on the front of the cell so that when they\u2019re infused back in they know where to go and kill the lymphoma,\u201d said Dr. Frederick Locke, who helped lead the trial.\n\nDr. Frederick Locke CBS News\n\nAbout eight months after a single treatment, 39 percent of patients had no evidence of cancer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually quite remarkable knowing that at best only one out of 10 of these patients could have complete disappearance of their lymphoma with standard chemotherapy,\u201d Locke said.\n\nSide effects included flu-like symptoms and confusion, and there were three treatment-related deaths.\n\nThe FDA will review these results and could make a decision on approval by the end of the year.", "images": ["https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/15/32d2ef7e-3db9-4b54-97ed-3abac33b15ec/thumbnail/300x190/6047566189301b2ea02f94f608d89295/5-inch-gun.jpg#", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/31/a7a6dfb9-705d-460c-8f19-44144b7ed155/thumbnail/1200x630/25928174e9be052253ad9713392e30ed/b2-lapook-cancer-treatment-transfe2r.jpg", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/12/9bacc25c-dd4f-4b6a-8047-557aca44490c/thumbnail/300x190/925b8d50ae8beb8a0d3a22466b3290f1/apollo-11-exterior-3d-scan.jpg#", "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/08/d05e390a-7dfc-4b43-8a64-842586d974c3/thumbnail/60x60/b0aef9e95d5ebe0e2708adead0c04d57/75252848-2413704752016642-1220120902222479360-n-1.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2015/02/27/9a77d295-1a09-4d2b-b817-2484edd8ef16/5780a305f2e8f89d33858173d333a58b/promocbsn.jpg#", "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/11/837aeeea-2d17-481e-8fca-d3a27df3e1b0/thumbnail/60x60/2b101038e7598cf8603bb08c34ce402e/1110-en-quilt-diaz3.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/07/365804d8-c2da-4106-a5b9-b83312304780/thumbnail/60x60/5db70bdc96f3a3169f18dbb09d3931db/shamlian-amputee-football-player-en-103119-frame-2478-2.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/08/8ef8eca3-17db-4ef6-b222-2a8a95e70cfe/thumbnail/60x60/b182cd8990ffae8de7f6dd14c9cb69ca/image.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/06/28/a7dcfe87-5539-4c24-bb6b-71cfbf0ab57d/thumbnail/300x190/9dc77e64cd4a676b357931aa31e3a581/shayda-kafai.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/07/f1a34230-9a16-4ecc-b301-7fe1a4e4d3fc/thumbnail/60x60/e61db39f662edac1c6913e6a449b5946/ctm-1107-paramedic.jpg#", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2009/11/06/5c92c167-a642-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/300x190/1e06413e873f09a464474bd52d4c940c/image5554754.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/31/a7a6dfb9-705d-460c-8f19-44144b7ed155/thumbnail/620x349/0fa8fccdfc0f5365502f213b55daa474/b2-lapook-cancer-treatment-transfe2r.jpg#", "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/04/9154e994-6d08-49cf-b257-726d39de48e1/thumbnail/60x60/27faaf7227e2780c7aadf9a9210da4fa/axelrod-wwe-ali-110419-en-frame-3212.jpg#", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/16/68b063e6-d0be-4928-a73c-f7500f44fa81/thumbnail/140x90/581551e33393b205006af7237d69eea6/dr-jon-lapook_bio_140x100_bw.jpg#", "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/31/809aa4ca-d72e-44ae-9612-dc86d3ca4de7/thumbnail/620x349/8e8fe27b91d7a8855662631c505c2237/b2-lapook-cancer-treatment-transfer.jpg#", "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/28/7f38e4cf-8d3b-45ea-96c0-66c5542a0242/thumbnail/300x190g2/a4d26a97bf67c79297bfa3f743eaba21/robert-evans-ap-19301624547509.jpg#"], "top_img": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/31/a7a6dfb9-705d-460c-8f19-44144b7ed155/thumbnail/1200x630/25928174e9be052253ad9713392e30ed/b2-lapook-cancer-treatment-transfe2r.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Lapook"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/promising-new-lymphoma-treatment-gets-fast-tracked-by-fda/", "title": "Promising new lymphoma treatment gets fast-tracked by FDA", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#101010", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "CAR-T immunotherapy &quot;puts a GPS navigation&quot;
