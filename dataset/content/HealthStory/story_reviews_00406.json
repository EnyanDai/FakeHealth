That\u2019s why doctors at the Cleveland Clinic will test deep brain stimulation (DBS)\u2014a procedure in which electrodes are implanted in the brain to provide small electric pulses as a way to help people recover control of their movements.\n\nThe hospital recently received the green light from federal authorities to start the first ever human trial of DBS for stroke, and plans to announce Tuesday that it will perform the procedure as soon as an initial patient is identified.\n\nHealth Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips.

With physical therapy, many people regain some motor function, but the brain damage cannot be reversed and many still have profound movement problems.\n\n\u201cDespite advances in physical therapy and acute treatment of stroke there are still too many people who live with long term disabilities, and new technologies are needed,\u201d said Dr. Andre Machado, the chairman of the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute who is leading the trial and will perform the procedures.\n\nDBS has been used to treat tremors associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease, but Machado said the new approach, if successful, will achieve something novel. \u201cThe big difference is that when we are treating the motor symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, we\u2019re trying to make the symptom, like a tremor, go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we are treating stroke, we are really trying to make movement come back. There is something inherently different about that.\u201d\n\nAnd inherently harder. DBS has never been used on humans as a way to regain a function. And experts aren\u2019t even entirely sure why it works for Parkinson\u2019s in the first place. But for 10 years, Machado and his team have been studying the effects of DBS on rats. They found that rats with strokes who received DBS had more proteins in the brain that are associated with brain plasticity\u2014and twice as many synapses or connections between nerve cells compared to rats with strokes who did not undergo DBS.\n\nIf all goes as planned, Machado will insert the electrodes in the brain of someone severely disabled by stroke who has exhausted all other options without improvement. The electrodes will be placed on parts of the brain that communicate with the damaged region and surrounding areas. The electrodes will be attached to a wire that connects them to a battery pack located under the skin in the chest\u2014the pack looks similar to a pacemaker. The stimulation will hopefully jump-start the brain\u2019s recovery process and help them gain more control while undergoing standard therapy.\n\nGet The Brief.

About 87% of all strokes are this type.\n\nDBS is a type of brain surgery, and comes with risks like bleeding, infection and need for more surgeries. Since the procedure is experimental, there may be some unknown risks as well. Depending on how the first procedure goes, the hospital will enroll more people into its trial. If ultimately successful, DBS could become a treatment used in tandem with physical rehabilitation. \u201cThe goal of this therapy is not to replace physical training, but rather to boost the effects,\u201d Machado said. \u201cThe proposition here is to make that recovery greater.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/forgiving-other-people-good-for-health.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "http://time.com/images/newsletter-time.png", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/brain.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/weight-loss-surgery.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/brain.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Sifferlin"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4382200/deep-brain-stimulation-for-stroke/", "title": "Stroke: Cleveland Clinic Will Test Deep Brain Stimulation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "stroke, deep brain stimulation, Cleveland Clinic, heart disease, humans, human trial", "news_keywords": "stroke, deep brain stimulation, Cleveland Clinic, heart disease, humans, human trial", "description": "For the first time, doctors in Cleveland will stimulate the brain of a person disabled by stroke to help them regain function", "og": {"title": "Exclusive: Doctors Will Test a Groundbreaking Treatment for Strokes", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4382200/deep-brain-stimulation-for-stroke/", "description": "Half of the 800,000 Americans who have a stroke every year end up disabled", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/brain.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4382200/deep-brain-stimulation-for-stroke/", "description": "For the first time, doctors in Cleveland will stimulate the brain of a person disabled by stroke to help them regain function", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/brain.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4382200/deep-brain-stimulation-for-stroke/", "title": "Exclusive: Doctors Will Test a Groundbreaking Treatment for Strokes", "description": "Half of the 800,000 Americans who have a stroke every year end up disabled", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/brain.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
