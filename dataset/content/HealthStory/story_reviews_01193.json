Park-Wyllie, of St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, who worked on the new study.\n\n\u201cWomen with osteoporosis who are at high risk of fractures should not stop taking their treatment,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\nBone drugs include Merck\u2019s Fosamax, Roche\u2019s Boniva, Novartis\u2019s Reclast, and Warner Chilcott\u2019s Actonel.\n\nSome 10 million Americans currently suffer from bone thinning, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The majority are postmenopausal women.\n\nPark-Wyllie and colleagues tapped into data on more than 205,000 Ontario women at least 68 years old who had taken the bone drugs. Their findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nOverall, 716 women suffered the unusual type of thighbone fracture after starting the bone drugs, and nearly 10,000 had typical hip fractures.\n\nThe risk of a thighbone fracture differed depending on how long the women had been taking the medicine. After taking bone drugs for five years, about one in 1,000 women went on to suffer a thigh fracture over the next year.\n\nThat works out to nearly three times the risk of those who\u2019d taken the drugs for roughly three months or less, after accounting for other risk factors.\n\nOn the other hand, longer treatment was tied to a 24-percent decrease in hip fractures, which along with wrist and spine fractures affect about half of all people with osteoporosis.\n\nThere are several alternative ways to treat osteoporosis, including hormone treatment for women. And one preliminary study, published along with the Canadian findings in JAMA, hints that the common heart medication nitroglycerin might also boost bone health.\n\nSo far, however, the cheap and effective bisphosphonate bone drugs remain the most popular treatment option. But some experts worry that negative media coverage might have led to more fractures and possibly deaths by dissuading patients from taking the drugs.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is that overstating the levels of risk of side effects with these drugs \u2014 which the media have been doing for some time now \u2014 has led people to stop the drugs when they should be taking them,\u201d said Dr. Ethel S. Siris, who heads the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at Columbia University in New York.\n\nApart from atypical fractures, the most serious side effect of the bone drugs is bone death, or osteonecrosis, of the jaw. But that\u2019s a very rare problem, experts say, which only affects about one in 100,000 people on bisphosphonates.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re taking the drugs and you\u2019ve been on them for a while, but aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019re at high risk, you should ask your doctor about it,\u201d Park-Wyllie advised.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal expert panel, recommends screening all women over 65 for osteoporosis.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/4HWZ7 JAMA/Journal of the American Medical Association, online February 22, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bone-drugs-idUSTRE71L7JK20110222", "title": "More unusual, fewer usual breaks with bone drugs", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women who take bone drugs for several years have a slightly increased chance of suffering an unusual type of thigh fracture, according to a large Canadian study.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "US,BONE,DRUGS", "news_keywords": "US;BONE;DRUGS", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Feb 22 21:28:53 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-02-22T21:28:53+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bone-drugs-idUSTRE71L7JK20110222", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "More unusual, fewer usual breaks with bone drugs", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,BONE,DRUGS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-BONE-DRUGS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "More unusual, fewer usual breaks with bone drugs", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2011-02-22T21:28:53+0000", "sailthru.title": "More unusual, fewer usual breaks with bone drugs", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "More unusual, fewer usual breaks with bone drugs", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bone-drugs-idUSTRE71L7JK20110222", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women who take bone drugs for several years have a slightly i...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-02-22T21:28:53+0000", "modified_time": "2011-02-22T21:28:53+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "US,BONE,DRUGS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "More unusual, fewer usual breaks with bone drugs", "description": "(Reuters Health) - Women who take bone drugs for several years have a slightly increased chance of suffering an unusual type of thigh fracture, according to a large Canadian study.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1298350800.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
