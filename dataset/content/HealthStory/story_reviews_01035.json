{"url": "http://www.Reuters.com/article/2011/08/02/us-colon-cancer-idUSTRE7714ZR20110802", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The inexpensive tests that look for hidden blood in a person\u2019s stool are effective for colon cancer screening, a study out Tuesday confirms.\n\nThe findings, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, give some extra weight to fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) as a valid option for early detection of colon cancer.\n\nExperts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. And they can pick from a number of tests that have all been found to cut the risk of dying from colon cancer.\n\nAlong with stool tests \u2014 done once a year at home \u2014 the choices include two invasive procedures: colonoscopy done every 10 years and flexible sigmoidoscopy done every five years.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally supported expert panel, recommends that people at average risk of colon cancer choose any of the three methods.\n\nFOBT detects hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colon cancer or pre-cancerous growths called polyps. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood.\n\nAdvances in the stool tests in recent years have made them more effective. A newer version called immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) is supposed to zero in on colon growths better than an older version known as guaiac FOBT \u2014 which often picked up bleeding originating in the upper digestive tract, such as from a stomach ulcer.\n\nImmunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But there\u2019s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly \u201cspecific\u201d to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study.\n\nSo for their study, the researchers followed nearly 2,800 adults who all volunteered to have iFOBT, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy to check for problems in the upper digestive tract.\n\nThey found that of 28 people confirmed to have colon tumors after a colonoscopy, all but one had also a positive iFOBT result.\n\n\u201cIt means that almost every case with colon cancer can be identified by iFOBT,\u201d Lee told Reuters Health in an email. \u201cIt is a strong support to iFOBT as an effective screening tool.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also found that iFOBT had \u201cspecificity\u201d for colon cancer of close to 90 percent, meaning the test would accurately give a negative result to almost 90 percent of people who did not have colon cancer.\n\nOf three study participants who were found to have cancers of the stomach or esophagus, for instance, none had a positive result on the iFOBT test.\n\nLike any screening test, iFOBT does have a risk of false-positive results, which leads to unnecessary invasive testing in some people. In this study, about 10 percent of all participants had a false-positive finding on the stool test.\n\nAmong the risk factors for false-positives the authors identified were the use of anticlotting drugs and low levels of the iron-rich molecule hemoglobin in the blood.\n\nIn practice, a positive iFOBT result would be followed by colonoscopy, in which a scope is used to investigate the interior of the colon.\n\nWhether used for first-line screening or as a follow-up, colonoscopy has the advantage of allowing doctors to spot and remove pre-cancerous growths called polyps \u2014 which means the test can prevent cases of colon cancer.\n\nBut as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\nAnd it\u2019s much cheaper: iFOBT is more expensive than the older stool tests, but it is still roughly $30. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.\n\nThe downside of iFOBT being specific to colon tumors is that it is not useful for catching cancers of the stomach or throat.\n\nThat\u2019s particularly important in Asia, where those cancers are common.\n\nLee said researchers there are looking into whether combining iFOBT with the older guaiac test is useful for catching cancers in the lower and upper digestive tract \u2014 and whether adding a third stool test, which looks for the ulcer-causing bacteria H. pylori, can help as well. Infection with H. pylori is associated with increased risks of stomach and throat cancers.\n\nIn the U.S., cancers of the upper digestive tract are relatively uncommon. The average American has a one in 200 chance of developing esophageal cancer, while the risk of stomach cancer is one in 114.\n\nIn contrast, Americans\u2019 lifetime risk of colon cancer is about one in 19, according to the American Cancer Society. More than 50,000 Americans died of the disease in 2010.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/mUOj1 Canadian Medical Association Journal, online August 2, 2011.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Norton", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colon-cancer-idUSTRE7714ZR20110802", "title": "Stool test good for catching colon cancer: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - The inexpensive tests that look for hidden blood in a person's stool are effective for colon cancer screening, a study out Tuesday confirms.", "Author": "Amy Norton", "keywords": "United States,US,COLON,CANCER", "news_keywords": "United States;US;COLON;CANCER", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Aug 02 17:40:53 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-08-02T17:40:53+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Amy Norton", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colon-cancer-idUSTRE7714ZR20110802", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Stool test good for catching colon cancer: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,US,COLON,CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-COLON-CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Stool test good for catching colon cancer: study", "sailthru.author": "Amy Norton", "sailthru.date": "2011-08-02T17:40:53+0000", "sailthru.title": "Stool test good for catching colon cancer: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Stool test good for catching colon cancer: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-colon-cancer-idUSTRE7714ZR20110802", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - The inexpensive tests that look for hidden blood in a person&...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-08-02T17:40:53+0000", "modified_time": "2011-08-02T17:40:53+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Amy Norton", "tag": "United States,US,COLON,CANCER"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Stool test good for catching colon cancer: study", "description": "(Reuters Health) - The inexpensive tests that look for hidden blood in a person's stool are effective for colon cancer screening, a study out Tuesday confirms.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1312257600.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
