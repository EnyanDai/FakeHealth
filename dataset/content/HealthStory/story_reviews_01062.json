In July 2010, an FDA panel voted 7-to-1 to approve the use of Brilinta for U.S. patients undergoing angioplasty or stenting to open blocked arteries, but the approval process is still ongoing.\n\nThe panel's recommendation was based in part on prior findings from this study, called the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial.\n\nIn this latest analysis of PLATO findings, researchers found that patients who took Brilinta with low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely than those who took Plavix with low-dose aspirin to have a heart attack or stroke, or to die within a year.\n\nThe findings were reported Monday in an American Heart Association online conference.\n\nOne expert said the new information is valuable.\n\n\"The study highlights that if one chooses to use ticagrelor in subjects with acute coronary syndromes, it would be logical to use aspirin 81 milligrams per day (and not 325 mg daily),\" said Dr. Jeffrey S. Berger, assistant professor of medicine and director of cardiovascular thrombosis at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. \"Of note, there is little reason to ever use aspirin 325 mg except in the acute setting of a heart attack or stroke,\" he added. \"A higher aspirin dose (325 mg versus 81 mg) increases the risk of bleeding without increasing the efficacy of the drug.\"\n\nA study author agreed that for most patients, using the drug with a lower dose of aspirin is usually warranted.\n\n\"Patients with acute coronary syndrome have options to prevent recurrent events,\" study lead author Dr. Kenneth W. Mahaffey, co-director of cardiovascular research at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, and associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, said in an AHA news release. \"Physicians choosing to use ticagrelor in countries where it is approved and available should consider using a low-dose of maintenance aspirin with the drug.\"\n\nThe data and conclusions of the research should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians outlines medicines used to treat patients with acute coronary syndrome.", "images": ["http://consumer.Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "http://consumer.Healthday.com/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Preidt"], "canonical_link": "https://consumer.healthday.com/general-health-information-16/aspirin-news-46/new-blood-thinner-beats-plavix-when-paired-with-low-dose-aspirin-654327.html", "title": "New Blood Thinner Beats Plavix When Paired With Low-Dose Aspirin", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1", "description": "But dose of aspirin was key to experimental drug Brilinta's success, study found", "og": {"title": "New Blood Thinner Beats Plavix When Paired With Low-Dose Aspirin", "description": "But dose of aspirin was key to experimental drug Brilinta's success, study found", "url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/general-health-information-16/aspirin-news-46/new-blood-thinner-beats-plavix-when-paired-with-low-dose-aspirin-654327.html", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://consumer.Healthday.com", "summary": ""}
