REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nBut the authors of the study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, stopped short of recommending people take a daily magnesium supplement because their analysis focused on magnesium in food \u2014 and it may be another aspect of the food that is responsible for their finding.\n\n\u201cDietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,\u201d wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with \u201cmagnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,\u201d she added.\n\nLarsson and her colleagues combed through research databases spanning the last 45 years to find studies that tracked how much magnesium people took and how many of them had a stroke over time.\n\nIn seven studies published in the past 14 years, about 250,000 people in the United States, Europe and Asia were followed for an average of 11.5 years. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed.\n\nFor every extra 100 milligrams of magnesium a person ate per day, their risk of an ischemic stroke \u2014 the most common kind, typically caused by a blood clot \u2014 fell by nine percent.\n\nThe median magnesium intake for U.S. citizens included in the analysis was 242 milligrams a day. The United States recommends that men and women over age 31 eat 420 and 320 milligrams of magnesium daily, respectively.\n\nMost of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history.\n\nBut Larsson told Reuters Health in an email that she could not say whether other aspects of what the people ate partially or entirely explained the finding.\n\nMore in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added.\n\nOther experts said the results were consistent with dietary recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a diet that\u2019s rich in fruits, vegetables and grains. Those are things that have low sodium, high potassium and high magnesium,\u201d said Larry Goldstein, director of the stroke center at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n\"It's again the diet per se, not any one individual component of the diet.\" SOURCE: bit.ly/AhalBY", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120116&t=2&i=558789343&r=BTRE80F07GS00&w=20", "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120116&t=2&i=558789343&w=1200&r=BTRE80F07GS00"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120116&t=2&i=558789343&w=1200&r=BTRE80F07GS00", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stroke-idUSTRE80F03L20120116", "title": "Magnesium-rich diet may lower stroke risk: study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;medical-research;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "People who eat lots of magnesium-rich foods such as leafy green vegetables, nuts and beans have fewer strokes, according to an international analysis covering some 250,000 people.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "Sweden,United States,Larry Goldstein,SUSAN LARSON,US,STROKE,Magnesium,General News,Sweden,Company News,Health / Medicine,Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Healthcare (TRBC),United States", "news_keywords": "Sweden;United States;Larry Goldstein;SUSAN LARSON;US;STROKE;Magnesium;General News;Sweden;Company News;Health / Medicine;Europe;Living / Lifestyle;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC);Science;Healthcare (TRBC);United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Jan 16 02:41:16 UTC 2012", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2012-01-16T02:41:16+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stroke-idUSTRE80F03L20120116", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Magnesium-rich diet may lower stroke risk: study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Sweden,United States,Larry Goldstein,SUSAN LARSON,US,STROKE,Magnesium,General News,Sweden,Company News,Health / Medicine,Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Healthcare (TRBC),United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-STROKE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Magnesium-rich diet may lower stroke risk: study", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2012-01-16T02:41:16+0000", "sailthru.title": "Magnesium-rich diet may lower stroke risk: study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Magnesium-rich diet may lower stroke risk: study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stroke-idUSTRE80F03L20120116", "type": "article", "description": "People who eat lots of magnesium-rich foods such as leafy green vegetables, nuts...", "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120116&t=2&i=558789343&w=1200&r=BTRE80F07GS00", "article": {"published_time": "2012-01-16T02:41:16+0000", "modified_time": "2012-01-16T02:41:16+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "Sweden,United States,Larry Goldstein,SUSAN LARSON,US,STROKE,Magnesium,General News,Sweden,Company News,Health / Medicine,Europe,Living / Lifestyle,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Healthcare (TRBC),United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Magnesium-rich diet may lower stroke risk: study", "description": "People who eat lots of magnesium-rich foods such as leafy green vegetables, nuts and beans have fewer strokes, according to an international analysis covering some 250,000 people.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120116&t=2&i=558789343&w=1200&r=BTRE80F07GS00", "src": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120116&t=2&i=558789343&w=1200&r=BTRE80F07GS00"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
