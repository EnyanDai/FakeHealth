{"url": "http://time.com/3936636/diet-gut-bacteria/", "text": "You no longer live in a world where you can pretend you\u2019re only eating for one; the trillions of bacteria in your gut, we now know, also feed on what you put in your mouth\u2014and they behave very differently depending on what that is.\n\nIt\u2019s increasingly clear that the composition of your gut bacteria likely influences your risk for many health problems, from obesity and type-2 diabetes and even certain autoimmune diseases. Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that\u2019s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial\u2014and how to protect them. A recent study published in The BMJ adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient. (Unfortunately, less than 3% of Americans eat the government-recommended amount daily.)\n\n\u201cYou really hold the reins to guiding this community [of bacteria] through the choices you make,\u201d says Justin L. Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of The Good Gut. Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.\n\nThe authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: Akkermansia muciniphila\u2014a strain that\u2019s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.\n\nThe people who had more Akkermansia in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high-Akkermansia group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. \u201cWe discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of Akkermansia were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.\u201d\n\nHigher levels of Akkermansia, the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.\n\nThe good news is that your initial Akkermansia levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of Akkermansia had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani\u2019s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.\n\nNow, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer Akkermansia alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. \u201cIf we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,\u201d he says.\n\nGet The Brief.

It\u2019s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. \u201cWe start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,\u201d he says.\n\nLoading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn\u2019t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers\u2014those, like inulin, which are added to foods\u2014haven\u2019t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. \u201cAll of the vegetables we\u2019re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,\u201d Sonnenburg says.\n\nNuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber\u2014as are vegetables. \u201cYou can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,\u201d Sonnenburg says. \u201cI find that a really nice way to eat\u2014just kind of gorging myself on plant material.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mandy Oaklander at mandy.oaklander@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/Paper-plane.svg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/burger-take-out-diet-junk-food-health.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/hamburgers-and-fries.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/soda-can-drink-diet-health-fitness.jpg?quality=85&w=600", "http://pixel.carambo.la/Pixel/tmnc11/112753/0/1/0", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-beets.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-beets.jpg", "http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://pixel.watch/f3fo"], "top_img": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-beets.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mandy Oaklander"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/3936636/diet-gut-bacteria/", "title": "Fiber and High Fiber Foods: Changing Your Diet Changes Gut Bacteria", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "akkermansia,diet,Diet/Nutrition,fiber,fiber foods,good gut,gut bacteria,gut bugs,high fiber foods,justin sonnenburg,lactobacillus,microbes,prebiotics,probiotics,Vegetables", "news_keywords": "fiber, probiotics, prebiotics, gut bacteria, gut bugs, microbes, akkermansia, lactobacillus, vegetables, high fiber foods, fiber foods, diet, good gut, justin sonnenburg", "description": "A new study published in The BMJ adds to the growing evidence that fiber may be the best nutrient to nourish gut bacteria and microbes", "og": {"title": "How Changing Your Diet Changes Your Gut Bacteria", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/3936636/diet-gut-bacteria/", "description": "Finally, the motivation you've been waiting for to gorge yourself on fiber", "image": {"identifier": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-beets.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/3936636/diet-gut-bacteria/", "description": "A new study published in The BMJ adds to the growing evidence that fiber may be the best nutrient to nourish gut bacteria and microbes", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-beets.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/3936636/diet-gut-bacteria/", "title": "How Changing Your Diet Changes Your Gut Bacteria", "description": "Finally, the motivation you've been waiting for to gorge yourself on fiber", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/time-50-healthiest-foods-beets.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=512&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
