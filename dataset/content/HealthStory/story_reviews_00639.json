Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers. Autism is considered by most experts to be a lifelong condition, but numerous studies have found that children's outcomes improve with early therapy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of state and federal funding are being spent each year to provide help to children and adults with autism and being able to pinpoint children at risk in the early years could help direct those public resources to where they could do the most good.\n\nBrain imaging has become a popular subject of research in recent years as the technology to be able to scan, store and analyze the terabytes of information in the pictures has become more affordable. Scientists at a growing number of research centers are pinning their hopes that these images will help them unlock some of the secrets of everything from what causes childhood disorders like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to how neurons in the brain process vision and memory.\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/m6aaXw2Jd5FFyG0DvtBfHOBDdeo=/150x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JW47EA2LP4ZBXONDWHAYHAV5XE.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KHaoGQ4Oyc92lVjrWLXcV-YX5GI=/90x90/smart/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/8c3365b4-0b14-4270-ab2a-627279e3b650.png", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3lWUPso9BDcZfwWyI-zDU0sV14w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JW47EA2LP4ZBXONDWHAYHAV5XE.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3lWUPso9BDcZfwWyI-zDU0sV14w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JW47EA2LP4ZBXONDWHAYHAV5XE.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Eunjung Cha", "National Reporter", "Staff Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/04/09/brain-images-appear-to-predict-which-toddlers-may-have-autism-and-struggle-with-language/", "title": "Toddler brain images reveal which may have autism and struggle with language", "meta_data": {"description": "Scientists have found that brain scans of toddlers who are on the autism spectrum are starkly different from those who do not and that the scans of those who have good language ability are very different from those who have poor language ability.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/04/09/brain-images-appear-to-predict-which-toddlers-may-have-autism-and-struggle-with-language/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3lWUPso9BDcZfwWyI-zDU0sV14w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JW47EA2LP4ZBXONDWHAYHAV5XE.jpg", "title": "Toddler brain images reveal which may have autism and struggle with language", "description": "Scientists have found that brain scans of toddlers who are on the autism spectrum are starkly different from those who do not and that the scans of those who have good language ability are very different from those who have poor language ability."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Toddler brain images reveal which may have autism and struggle with language", "description": "Scientists have found that brain scans of toddlers who are on the autism spectrum are starkly different from those who do not and that the scans of those who have good language ability are very different from those who have poor language ability."}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1428552000.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
