The new study, which only involved 28 patients, is modest fillip.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrated that the drug has an effect on the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d lead researcher Juha Rinne from Finland\u2019s University of Turku told Reuters.\n\nRinne and colleagues used a novel imaging substance called carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B, which sticks to areas of the brain where there is a lot of beta amyloid plaque.\n\nAfter 78 weeks, they found that patients given bapineuzumab had about a 25 percent reduction in plaque compared with those on placebo. The effect was similar with three different doses of the drug, they reported in the journal Lancet Neurology.\n\nThe treatment was generally well tolerated, although two patients on the highest dose had transient brain swelling. The drug\u2019s developers have since dropped the top dose from large ongoing Phase III trials.\n\nCommenting on the results, Sam Gandy from New York\u2019s Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it was too early to say effective disease-modifying drugs were at hand, but the ability to measure plaque in living subjects was \u201csomething of a breakthrough\u201d.\n\nExperts are divided on the root cause of Alzheimer\u2019s and hence the best way to tackle it.\n\nMost advanced drugs, like bapineuzumab, have focused on removing clumps of amyloid plaques, which are thought to stop brain cells from functioning properly. But a rival school blames toxic tangles caused by an abnormal build-up of the protein tau.\n\nRinne\u2019s imaging study was funded by Elan and Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer.
