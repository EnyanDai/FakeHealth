It includes a decade\u2019s worth of data from more than 100,000 men and women in the U.S., most over 60 and all of them non-smokers.\n\nPeople who said they took daily aspirin - whether \u2018baby\u2019 or adult strength - had a 16-percent lower risk of dying from cancer than non-users overall, Thun and his colleagues found.\n\nFor men, the difference came out to 103 fewer cancer deaths a year per 100,000 people; for women, the number was 42.\n\nThe effect was strongest for gastrointestinal cancers, such as colon cancer and stomach cancer. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter whether people had been on aspirin for more or less than five years.\n\nBecause the study wasn\u2019t a clinical trial, it\u2019s hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play.\n\nStill, Thun said the results would favor broadening the aspirin guidelines to include cancer prevention based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. But he added that it will take scientists a few years to mull over all of the existing evidence.\n\nLONG-STANDING CONTROVERSY\n\nOther researchers are more skeptical. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George\u2019s University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds.\n\n\u201cThis is not a drug without side effects, so what you have to look at is net benefit,\u201d he told Reuters Health.\n\nEarlier this year, Ray\u2019s team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good.\n\nOne of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. People who develop stomach bleeding from aspirin are likely to get their bowels checked out by a doctor. As a result, doctors may find and remove tumors or precancerous polyps, which could prolong the patient\u2019s life - the idea behind colon cancer screening.\n\nSo far, most aspirin trials have been designed to test the drug\u2019s effect on heart disease. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have enough hard evidence suggesting everybody should be taking\u201d aspirin, Ray said.\n\nWhen it comes to cancer, the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force agrees. It discourages the use of aspirin to stave off colorectal cancer in people at average risk for the disease.\n\nSOURCE: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, August 10, 2012.", "images": ["http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120810&t=2&i=641092431&r=CBRE8791LXS00&w=20", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120810&t=2&i=641092431&w=1200&r=CBRE8791LXS00"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120810&t=2&i=641092431&w=1200&r=CBRE8791LXS00", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frederik Joelving", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aspirin-cancer-idUSBRE87914Z20120810", "title": "Can daily aspirin help ward off cancer?", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A new study bolsters the case that daily aspirin may help protect against cancer, although the effect seems weaker than previously thought.", "Author": "Frederik Joelving", "keywords": "United States,Kausik Ray,Michael Thun,US,ASPIRIN,CANCER", "news_keywords": "United States;Kausik Ray;Michael Thun;US;ASPIRIN;CANCER", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri Aug 10 20:51:28 UTC 2012", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2012-08-10T20:51:28+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Frederik Joelving", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aspirin-cancer-idUSBRE87914Z20120810", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Can daily aspirin help ward off cancer?", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Kausik Ray,Michael Thun,US,ASPIRIN,CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-ASPIRIN-CANCER", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Can daily aspirin help ward off cancer?", "sailthru.author": "Frederik Joelving", "sailthru.date": "2012-08-10T20:51:28+0000", "sailthru.title": "Can daily aspirin help ward off cancer?", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Can daily aspirin help ward off cancer?", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aspirin-cancer-idUSBRE87914Z20120810", "type": "article", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A new study bolsters the case that daily aspirin may help pro...", "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120810&t=2&i=641092431&w=1200&r=CBRE8791LXS00", "article": {"published_time": "2012-08-10T20:51:28+0000", "modified_time": "2012-08-10T20:51:28+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Frederik Joelving", "tag": "United States,Kausik Ray,Michael Thun,US,ASPIRIN,CANCER"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Can daily aspirin help ward off cancer?", "description": "(Reuters Health) - A new study bolsters the case that daily aspirin may help protect against cancer, although the effect seems weaker than previously thought.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120810&t=2&i=641092431&w=1200&r=CBRE8791LXS00", "src": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20120810&t=2&i=641092431&w=1200&r=CBRE8791LXS00"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1344571200.0, "source": "http://www.reuters.com", "summary": ""}
