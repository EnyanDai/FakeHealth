In a common form of cataracts, proteins in the lens change over time, developing chromophores \u2014 molecular add-ons that absorb color in the blue part of the spectrum. Chromophores reduce the amount of light reaching the retina (and give the lens a yellow-brown appearance), but they also disrupt the structure of the lens proteins, causing light to scatter.\n\nCataracts can be treated by lens-replacement surgery, but the procedure is invasive and costly, requiring special equipment and skilled eye surgeons. To make cataract treatment available to more people around the world, a less-invasive, less-expensive technique is needed.\n\nLine Kessel, an ophthalmologist at Glostrup Hospital of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and colleagues have come up with what they say is a promising alternative to replacement surgery. In their approach, described in the open-access journal PLoS ONE, they \u201cbleach\u201d the lens with a laser.\n\nUltraviolet light can alter chromophores so they no longer absorb color, but UV light can damage the retina. So the researchers use infrared light, delivered by an extremely fast-pulse laser. The pulses are so fast, Dr. Kessel said, that two photons hit a target molecule simultaneously, with the same effect as if UV light was used.\n\nThe laser treatment reduces the light absorption and also helps restore the lens proteins to their proper structure. Much more research and development work remains, Dr. Kessel said, but the goal is a relatively simple procedure that would last half an hour at most and use largely automated equipment in mobile clinics.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/03/23/science/23obmale/23obmale_CA0-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/03/23/science/23obpipe/23obpipe-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Henry Fountain"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23oblens.html", "title": "New Approach to Cataract Surgery Using Infrared Laser", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1247467420178", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23oblens.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23oblens.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1247467420178"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23oblens.html", "title": "New Approach to Cataract Surgery Using Infrared Laser", "description": "Scientists in Denmark are developing a new approach to treating cataracts that they hope will make treatment available in mobile clinics.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary", "creator": "henryfountain"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Laser Treatment May Work for Cataracts", "description": "Scientists in Denmark are developing a new approach to treating cataracts that they hope will make treatment available in mobile clinics.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1247467420178, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "New Approach to Cataract Surgery Using Infrared Laser", "col": "Observatory", "pdate": 20100322, "utime": 20150130122309, "ptime": 20100322192727, "DISPLAYDATE": "March 22, 2010", "dat": "March 22, 2010", "lp": "Scientists in Denmark are developing a new approach to treating cataracts that they hope will make treatment available in mobile clinics.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "23oblens", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/science/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-03-22T19:27:27-04:00", "modified": "2015-01-30T12:23:09-05:00", "section": "Science", "section-taxonomy-id": "A4B35924-DB6C-4EA3-997D-450810F4FEE6", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html", "top-level-section": "science", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/henryfountain", "tag": "Science and Technology"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/science/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23oblens.html", "type": "article", "title": "New Approach to Cataract Surgery Using Infrared Laser", "description": "Scientists in Denmark are developing a new approach to treating cataracts that they hope will make treatment available in mobile clinics.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Henry Fountain", "tone": "news", "byl": "By HENRY FOUNTAIN", "PT": "article", "CG": "science", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Science and Technology", "keywords": "Cataracts,Eyes and Eyesight,Laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation),Medicine and Health,Science and Technology", "nyt-collection": {"display-name": "Observatory", "identifier": "observatory", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/column/observatory", "uri": "/column/observatory", "tone": "feature", "tagline": "Dispatches from the world of scientific research.", "type": "column"}, "CN": "observatory", "CT": "column", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "science", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1269316800.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
