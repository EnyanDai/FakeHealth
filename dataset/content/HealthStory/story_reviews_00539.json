Now researchers report that a combination drug already in use for treating certain neurological problems may be a better remedy.\n\nDextromethorphan is a cough suppressant commonly found in over-the-counter cough medicines, and quinidine is a drug used to control heart rhythm disorders. In combination, they are used to treat pseudobulbar affect, a neurological disorder involving involuntary crying or other emotional displays.\n\nThe scientists randomized 152 Alzheimer\u2019s patients to a 10-week course of dextromethorphan-quinidine and 127 to placebo. Researchers then rated them using a well-validated scale that measures aggression and agitation. The study is in the Sept. 22 issue of JAMA.\n\nAggression scores declined to 3.8 from 7.1 in the dextromethorphan-quinidine group and to 5.3 from 7.0 in those who took a placebo. Then the researchers re-randomized those who did not respond to placebo to receive either drugs or placebo, and found similar encouraging results for the drug combination.\n\n\u201cFifty-five percent of the people who were on drugs had a 50 percent reduction in their agitation,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings, director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot when a patient is striking and hitting and cussing. There are no currently approved treatments for agitation, and we\u2019re very enthusiastic about this finding.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/health/well_behavior/well_behavior-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/marketing/newsletters/images/Running_75.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/health/well_behavior/well_behavior-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/well/well_post.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/health/well_behavior/well_behavior-superJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Bakalar"], "canonical_link": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/combination-drug-may-ease-the-agitation-of-alzheimers/", "title": "Combination Drug May Ease the Agitation of Alzheimer\u2019s", "meta_data": {"communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/Combination Drug May Ease the Agitation of Alzheimer's ( 20150924 )", "communityAssetURL": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/combination-drug-may-ease-the-agitation-of-alzheimers/", "PT": "Blogs", "PST": "Blog Post", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003934068, "author": "Nicholas Bakalar", "CLMST": "Nicholas Bakalar", "byl": "Nicholas Bakalar", "GBLC": "Featured;Mind", "PUV": "normal", "article": {"published_time": 1443087030, "modified_time": "2015-10-08T03:01:09-04:00", "section": "Health", "tag": "Mind", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp"}, "PUD": 20150924, "pdate": 20150924, "ptime": 20150924053030, "utime": 20151008030109, "DISPLAYDATE": "September 24, 2015", "dat": "September 24, 2015", "CG": "Health", "SCG": "well", "BN": "well", "robots": "noodp", "des": "Alzheimer's Disease;Research", "keywords": "Alzheimer's Disease,Research,Featured,Mind", "news_keywords": "Alzheimer's,Research", "description": "A combination drug may be a safer way to treat agitation and aggression in people with Alzheimer\u2019s.", "hdl_p": "Behavior: Easing Agitation of Alzheimeru2019s", "hdl": "Combination Drug May Ease the Agitation of Alzheimer's", "og": {"title": "Combination Drug May Ease the Agitation of Alzheimer's", "type": "article", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/combination-drug-may-ease-the-agitation-of-alzheimers/", "site_name": "Well", "description": "A combination drug may be a safer way to treat agitation and aggression in people with Alzheimer\u2019s.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/health/well_behavior/well_behavior-superJumbo.jpg"}, "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/health/well_behavior/well_behavior-thumbLarge.jpg", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Combination Drug May Ease the Agitation of Alzheimer's", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/combination-drug-may-ease-the-agitation-of-alzheimers/", "description": "A combination drug may be a safer way to treat agitation and aggression in people with Alzheimer\u2019s.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/health/well_behavior/well_behavior-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimeswell"}, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/19/health/well_behavior/well_behavior-thumbLarge.jpg", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well/mind", "categories": "mind"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1443067200.0, "source": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
