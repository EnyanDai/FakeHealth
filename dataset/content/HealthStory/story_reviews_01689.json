There is no vaccine or easy, effective treatment for RSV.\n\nPOPGis one of several lipids found in the fluid that lines the air sacs of the lungs. Researchers say that until now, the function of POPG has been unclear.\n\nIn the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers examined the effects of POPG on RSV infection in human lung cells in the lab and in mice infected with the virus.\n\nThey found that inoculating human lung cells with POPG before exposure to RSV prevented infection with the virus as well as the cell death and inflammation normally associated with RSV infection. Applying POPG to the cells after RSV infection also inhibited the spread of the virus to neighboring healthy cells.\n\nIn addition, the study showed treating infected mice with POPG dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs.\n\nResearchers say POPG appears to work by binding to RSV and preventing it from binding to other cells. The findings also suggest that POPG\u2019s role in the lungs may be to help the lungs tolerate the daily barrage of inhaled irritants.\n\nPOPG is already used in other treatments and has been safely given to millions of premature infants to protect their lungs. It is also inexpensive and easy to use.\n\nTherefore, together with the results of this study, researchers say the compound merits further research as a treatment for RSV infection in humans.",
