Made from parallel strands of the protein collagen, it refracts light to focus images on the retina.\n\nAlthough the fragile film is easily destroyed by trauma or infection, replacement human corneas can be used to restore vision, although this depends on a steady supply of donors.\n\nA team led by Griffith and Per Fagerholm, an ophthalmology professor and eye surgeon at Linkoping University in Sweden, conducted the study by removing diseased tissue from the corneas of 10 patients and replacing them with biosynthetic implants designed to mimic a normal human cornea.\n\nFor the process they used recombinant human collagen, a substance synthesized in the laboratory to mimic human tissue and supplied by the San Francisco biotech firm FibroGen Inc.\n\nThe patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The researchers found that, eventually, the cells and nerves from nine of the 10 patients regrew completely and packed themselves into the implant, resulting in a kind of \u201cregenerated\u201d cornea that looked and functioned like normal, healthy eye tissue.\n\nThe biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said. Vision improved in six of the 10 patients.\n\nAfter the patients were also fitted with contact lenses, which is common after corneal transplants, their vision was comparable with that of patients who undergo regular human corneal tissue transplants.\n\n\u201cThe results were pretty encouraging and there is great potential here,\u201d Fagerholm said in a telephone interview.\n\nLoss of vision due to corneal disease or trauma affects over 10 million people a year, but lack of access to donor tissue limits the number of transplants, particularly in poorer countries.\n\nIn the United States, an estimated 42,000 corneal grafts a year are performed using tissue from posthumous donors, but there are sometimes problems with rejection and experts say failure rates are significant.\n\nFagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corneas-idUSTRE67O4R320100825", "title": "Scientists use synthetic corneas to restore vision", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Scientists in Canada and Sweden have used laboratory-made biosynthetic corneas to restore vision to patients in a small human trial, and shown for the first time that they can help to repair damaged eye tissue.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "Canada,Sweden,United States,Kevin Liffey,Kate Kelland,May Griffith,Per Fagerholm,US,CORNEAS", "news_keywords": "Canada;Sweden;United States;Kevin Liffey;Kate Kelland;May Griffith;Per Fagerholm;US;CORNEAS", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Aug 25 18:03:22 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-08-25T18:03:22+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corneas-idUSTRE67O4R320100825", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Scientists use synthetic corneas to restore vision", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Canada,Sweden,United States,Kevin Liffey,Kate Kelland,May Griffith,Per Fagerholm,US,CORNEAS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CORNEAS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Scientists use synthetic corneas to restore vision", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2010-08-25T18:03:22+0000", "sailthru.title": "Scientists use synthetic corneas to restore vision", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Scientists use synthetic corneas to restore vision", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-corneas-idUSTRE67O4R320100825", "type": "article", "description": "Scientists in Canada and Sweden have used laboratory-made biosynthetic corneas t...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-08-25T18:03:22+0000", "modified_time": "2010-08-25T18:03:22+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "Canada,Sweden,United States,Kevin Liffey,Kate Kelland,May Griffith,Per Fagerholm,US,CORNEAS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Scientists use synthetic corneas to restore vision", "description": "Scientists in Canada and Sweden have used laboratory-made biosynthetic corneas to restore vision to patients in a small human trial, and shown for the first time that they can help to repair damaged e...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
