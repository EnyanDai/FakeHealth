For this case-control study, researchers recruited 5,307 colonoscopy patients, 60 percent of them men, at two Tennessee hospitals over a seven-year period ending in April 2010. The analysis appears online in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.\n\nThey found 2,141 people with polyps, leaving 3,166 polyp-free controls. All patients were interviewed about diet, health habits and medical history.\n\nAfter controlling for age, race, body mass index, smoking and other factors, the researchers found that women in the highest fifth for omega-3 consumption \u2014 those who consumed three or more servings of fish a week \u2014 were 33 percent less likely than women in the lowest fifth to have adenomatous polyps, a type likely to become cancerous.\n\nThe researchers found no effect in men, and no effect of omega-3 consumption on hyperplastic polyps, which are more likely to be benign.\n\n\u201cThis is more evidence to suggest that omega-3s are beneficial and may have anti-inflammatory action helpful in reducing cancer risk,\u201d said the lead author, Dr. Harvey J. Murff, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Bakalar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/health/research/fish-help-reduce-risk-of-one-kind-of-colon-polyp-in-women.html", "title": "Fish Help Reduce Risk of One Kind of Colon Polyp in Women", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001372558", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/health/research/fish-help-reduce-risk-of-one-kind-of-colon-polyp-in-women.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/health/research/fish-help-reduce-risk-of-one-kind-of-colon-polyp-in-women.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001372558"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/health/research/fish-help-reduce-risk-of-one-kind-of-colon-polyp-in-women.html", "title": "Fish Help Reduce Risk of One Kind of Colon Polyp in Women", "description": "A study has found that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish is associated with a reduced risk for one kind of colon polyp, but only in women.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Prevention: Fish Helps Reduce Risk of Polyps in Women", "description": "A study has found that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish is associated with a reduced risk for one kind of colon polyp, but only in women.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 100000001372558, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Fish Help Reduce Risk of One Kind of Colon Polyp in Women", "col": "Vital Signs", "pdate": 20120220, "utime": 20140819175502, "ptime": 20120220134716, "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 20, 2012", "dat": "Feb. 20, 2012", "lp": "A study has found that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish is associated with a reduced risk for one kind of colon polyp, but only in women.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "21prevention", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2012-02-20T13:47:16-05:00", "modified": "2014-08-19T17:55:02-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "top-level-section": "health", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-bakalar", "tag": "Dietary Supplements and Herbal Remedies"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/health/research/fish-help-reduce-risk-of-one-kind-of-colon-polyp-in-women.html", "type": "article", "title": "Fish Help Reduce Risk of One Kind of Colon Polyp in Women", "description": "A study has found that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish is associated with a reduced risk for one kind of colon polyp, but only in women.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Nicholas Bakalar", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By NICHOLAS BAKALAR", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "SCG": "research", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Dietary Supplements and Herbal Remedies", "keywords": "Women and Girls,Cancer,Medicine and Health,Colon,Colon and Colorectal Cancer,Dietary Supplements and Herbal Remedies", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/research", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1329800400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
