Tesone, who is now 42, was diagnosed with Leber\u2019s hereditary optic neuropathy which is a genetic disease that rapidly clouds a patient\u2019s central vision.\n\nTesone, whose brother has the condition as well, told FoxNews.com that she sees \u201cthrough a dense fog.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as though there is a big black spot. Your peripheral vision begins to take over,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI get a whole image of a whole room, for example, but what I don\u2019t have is clarity.\u201d\n\nTesone didn\u2019t allow the diagnosis to alter her life plans, and though she was saddened by the news, she was determined to live a successful and fulfilling life.\n\n\u201cYou have to decide what accommodations you\u2019re going to make for yourself in your home life and work life and figure them out,\u201d she said.\n\nTesone began to utilize different tools, from talking computers to magnifiers that project images on to a large screen. These large and bulky gadgets served as a modest improvement to her life but it was her husband who found an item that she said makes her life much more efficient.\n\nHer husband, a computer programmer, was attending a conference and heard about a device called the OrCam, which helps those who are visually impaired. He was able to get one for his wife so she can be part of the beta testing.\n\n\u201cOrCam is a portable intuitive smart camera that someone wears on their glasses,\u201d Bryan Wolynski, an optometrist who promotes OrCam to doctors and trains patients on how to use the device, told FoxNews.com.\n\n\u201cIt fits on their own right side temple of their glasses, takes a picture and then speaks to the wearer what it sees,\u201d he said.\n\nThe camera, which is about the size of a lighter, is connected by a wire to a power pack that can fit in a pocket or purse. It is activated when a patient points at a subject, or presses a button on the power pack. The camera takes a picture and instantaneously reads what it sees. OrCam can read print on a newspaper or a piece of mail. It also can be trained to recognize a person\u2019s face or any household object.\n\nOrCam costs $3,500, but Wolynski believes the outcome worth the price.\n\n\u201cI have seen a person cry when being able to read for the first time in many years,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother ophthalmologist, Dr. Marc Werner, also believes that OrCam is a useful device, but he said there are some drawbacks.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t always get every word exactly correctly, so if you\u2019re reading a long book, it may not be the best way to do it,\u201d he said, adding \u201cbut certainly there is nothing out there as far as I know that lets you read a newspaper or get the gist of the story even if it\u2019s going to miss a few words or a few concepts, it\u2019s still far better than what\u2019s out there right now.\u201d\n\nTesone agrees because of how much more efficient her life is now, both at work and at home. Reading one piece of paper on a magnifier could take her sometimes up to 20 minutes because she almost had to read letter by letter. Now, the OrCam takes about 30 seconds to read, scan and dictate the letter back to her.\n\n\u201cI have time at home with my children because I could just read something and be done. It\u2019s just so amazing to be able to do,\u201d Tesone said.\n\nFor more information about OrCam click here.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/876/493/100115_health_orcam_640.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-801796h&cg=0&cc=1&si=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/07/orcam-helps-blind-see-again/&ts=noscript&rnd=1444510033582", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9013181&c3=&c4=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/07/orcam-helps-blind-see-again/&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.2&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://dbg52463.moatads.com/?a=FoxNews", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://d5i9o0tpq9sa1.cloudfront.net/?a=FoxNews", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/100115_health_orcam_640.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://metrics.foxnews.com/b/ss/foxnews/1/H22.1--NS/1444510033582?pageName=noscript:health:front:article&g=http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/07/orcam-helps-blind-see-again/"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710im_/http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn2/video/0/0/100115_health_orcam_640.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Avinash Ramsadeen"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20151010204710/http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/07/orcam-helps-blind-see-again/", "title": "OrCam helps the blind math teacher 'see' again", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "OrCam helps the blind math teacher 'see' again", "dc.creator": "Avinash Ramsadeen", "description": "Eighteen years ago, math teacher Susan Tesone went from having perfect vision to being so visually impaired she wasn\u2019t able to drive in just four weeks.
