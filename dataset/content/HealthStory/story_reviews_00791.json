The function of cartilage is to reduce friction in the joints and serve as a \"shock absorber.\" The wearing away of cartilage leads to pain and other symptoms.\n\nNearly one in 100 people have evidence of knee osteoarthritis on an X-ray. And nearly 19% of women and 14% of men age 45 and older have joint pain, stiffness, and other symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, according to a large 2007 study.\n\nStudy head Jean-Yves Reginster, MD, PhD, presented the findings today at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. He is president and chair of the department of public health sciences at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium.", "images":
