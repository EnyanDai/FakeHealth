New stretch marks were also softer and smoother in 54 women who used the cream for three months, says Zoe Draelos, MD, a consulting professor of dermatology at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. \"The stretch marks did not go away,\" she tells WebMD. \"But [after several weeks of treatment], the cream made them look and feel better,\" she says. The study, funded by Merz Pharmaceuticals, which makes the cream, was presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology. Draelos has served as a consultant to Merz.\n\nStretch Marks Affect Men, Too Draelos estimates that up to 98% of women and 75% of men have stretch marks, which appear as wavy, linear red scars, typically on the hips, breasts, thighs, and stomach of women, and the buttocks and pectoralarea of men. They form when the skin is rapidly stretched, such as during puberty, pregnancy, and rapid weight gain, says Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York City. He was not involved with the research. \"Unfortunately, stretch marks are permanent. Exercise and diet won't help,\" he says. They're not harmful to your health, but many people are bothered by their appearance. The marks slowly fade and become flat on their own, but that can take years. As a result, doctors have been looking for a product to make new stretch marks look and feel better, Draelos says.", "images":
