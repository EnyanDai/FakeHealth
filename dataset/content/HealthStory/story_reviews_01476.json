The volunteers took pills once a day for six weeks.\n\nFasting blood samples were taken at the start of the trial and then at intervals of one, three, and six weeks.\n\nResults showed that resveratrol suppressed the generation of \u201cfree radicals\u201d -- unstable molecules known to cause oxidative stress and release pro-inflammatory substances into the blood, resulting in damage to the blood vessel lining.\n\nPeople taking resveratrol also showed suppression of the inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, and other compounds that increase blood vessel inflammation and interfere with insulin action, causing insulin resistance and the risk of developing diabetes.\n\nBlood samples from those on placebo showed no significant change in pro-inflammatory markers.", "images":
