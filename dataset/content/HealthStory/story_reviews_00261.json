They\u2019re all in the brain.\n\nVarious smartphone apps say they offer this kind of vision-improving training; I used one called GlassesOff, the only one I found that was backed by scientific studies.\n\nPerceptual learning can improve the vision of people who already see quite well and those with other conditions. For example, a study tested the approach in 23 young adults, around age 24. Compared with a control group of 20 young adults, the treatment group increased letter recognition speed. Similar training is an effective component in treating amblyopia, also called \u201clazy eye,\u201d which is the most frequent cause of vision loss in infants and children, affecting 3 percent of the population. It may also improve vision in those with mild myopia (nearsightedness).\n\nIt should be acknowledged that some researchers involved in many of these studies have financial ties to GlassesOff. However, other studies with no commercial links obtained similar results, and several scientists I spoke to, including those without ties to GlassesOff, thought the science behind the app was credible. One study published in Psychological Science trained 16 college-aged adults and 16 older adults (around age 71) with Gabor patch exercises for 1.5 hours per day for seven days. After training, the older adults\u2019 ability to see low-contrast images improved to the level that the college-age ones had before training.\n\nScientists don\u2019t know exactly how perceptual learning relieves presbyopia, but they have some clues based on how our brain processes visual information.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/upshot/28up-healthglasses/28up-healthglasses-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/upshot/28up-healthglasses/28up-healthglasses-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/upshot/28up-healthglasses/28up-healthglasses-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Austin Frakt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html", "title": "Training Your Brain So That You Don\u2019t Need Reading Glasses", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-03-27T09:30:05.000Z", "modified": "2017-03-27T09:30:04.000Z", "section": "The Upshot", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/austin-frakt", "tag": "Brain", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004973721, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/41016976-120d-5244-af41-d0b874668e2a", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/15644bfd858941ca84534079b9908e63", "description": "A monthslong regimen can compensate for what eye muscles no longer can do.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/upshot/28up-healthglasses/28up-healthglasses-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Austin Frakt", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/upshot/28up-healthglasses/28up-healthglasses-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Eyes and Eyesight,Glasses,Brain", "pdate": 20170327, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html", "type": "article", "title": "Training Your Brain So That You Don\u2019t Need Reading Glasses", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/upshot/28up-healthglasses/28up-healthglasses-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "A screenshot of a Gabor patch from the GlassesOff app tutorial."}, "description": "A monthslong regimen can compensate for what eye muscles no longer can do."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html", "title": "Training Your Brain So That You Don\u2019t Need Reading Glasses", "description": "A monthslong regimen can compensate for what eye muscles no longer can do.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/upshot/28up-healthglasses/28up-healthglasses-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "A screenshot of a Gabor patch from the GlassesOff app tutorial."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004973721"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "upshot", "CN": "the-new-health-care", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004973721", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/27/upshot/training-your-brain-so-that-you-dont-need-reading-glasses.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1490587200.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
