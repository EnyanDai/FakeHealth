REUTERS/Joshua Lott\n\nBut a few experts say you might want to ask your server to hold the statin at this point.\n\nIn a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, scientists from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London calculated that the reduction in heart disease risk offered by a statin could offset the increase in risk from eating a cheeseburger and a milkshake.\n\n\u201cStatins don\u2019t cut out all of the unhealthy effects of a burger and fries. It\u2019s better to avoid fatty food altogether. But we\u2019ve worked out that in terms of your likelihood of having a heart attack, taking a statin can reduce your risk to more or less the same degree as a fast food meal increases it,\u201d said Dr. Darrel Francis, who led the research team.\n\n\u201cWhen people engage in risky behaviors like driving or smoking, they\u2019re encouraged to take measures that minimize their risk, like wearing a seatbelt or choosing cigarettes with filters. Taking a statin is a rational way of lowering some of the risks of eating a fatty meal.\u201d\n\nStill, Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) health charity, said Francis\u2019 idea should not be taken too literally. He urged people to focus on maintaining a good diet and taking exercise to keep their hearts healthy.\n\n\u201cStatins are a vital medicine for people with \u2014 or at high risk of developing \u2014 heart disease,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not a magic bullet.\u201d\n\nA study in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggested, in fact, that statins do not save lives in patients without heart disease, although they may prevent some non-fatal heart attacks.\n\nDr. Franz Messerli, the director of the hypertension program at two New York hospitals, St. Luke\u2019s and Roosevelt, worried about the message handing out statins would send to burger-eaters.\n\n\u201cComplimentary statin packets are prone to ... give Quarter Pounder consumers a sense of false security,\u201d he told Reuters Health by email.\n\nWhile statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there\u2019s a lot they can\u2019t negate: \u201csodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,\u201d Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at.\n\nStatins are among the most widely used drugs for the treatment and prevention of heart disease and strokes \u2014 the world\u2019s top killers.\n\nOne statin, a generic drug called simvastatin, is already available in low doses over the counter at pharmacies in Britain without a prescription. Other statins such as Pfizer\u2019s Lipitor and AstraZeneca\u2019s Crestor - which are among the biggest-selling drugs in the world \u2014 are for prescription only.\n\nIn the U.S., all statins are only available by prescription.\n\n\u201cAlthough no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,\u201d the scientists write in their paper.\n\nFrancis\u2019 team \u2014 who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research \u2014 used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person\u2019s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats.\n\nThey compared this with the decrease in risk from taking statins, using data from seven previously published trials.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense to make risk-reducing supplements available just as easily as the unhealthy condiments (such as salt or ketchup) that are provided free of charge,\u201d Francis said in his report of the research. \u201cIt would cost less than 5 pence ($0.07) per customer \u2014 not much different to a sachet of ketchup.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: link.reuters.com/gak74n American Journal of Cardiology, online August 12, 2010.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100813&t=2&i=179074056&r=2010-08-13T130307Z_01_BTRE67C109900_RTROPTP_0_USA&w=20", "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100813&t=2&i=179074056&w=1200&r=2010-08-13T130307Z_01_BTRE67C109900_RTROPTP_0_USA"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20100813&t=2&i=179074056&w=1200&r=2010-08-13T130307Z_01_BTRE67C109900_RTROPTP_0_USA", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-burger-statin-idUSTRE67C2GE20100813", "title": "Burger and a statin to go?
