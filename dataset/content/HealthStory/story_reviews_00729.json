Sanofi and Regeneron say there are also preliminary signs dupilumab works against the skin condition atopic dermatitis, suggesting it can be blocking a biological pathway that contributes to multiple allergic conditions.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/22/business/22-DRUG/22-DRUG-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/22/business/22-DRUG/22-DRUG-articleLarge.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/22/business/22-DRUG/22-DRUG-articleLarge.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/business/dupilumab-a-new-drug-may-help-some-asthmatics.html", "title": "New Drug May Help Some Asthmatics, Study Finds", "meta_data": {"alternateTitle": "Dupilumab, a New Drug, May Help Some Asthmatics", "article": {"published": "2013-05-21T20:12:41.000Z", "modified": "2013-05-21T20:12:37.000Z", "section": "Business", "tag": "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000002237068, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/000e4da4-3ed5-5f60-8d80-2db5c6f1ba87", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/52ccc4f698ed4fd5a597838b3d2e89ea", "description": "The number of asthma attacks or other outbreaks of symptoms decreased by 87 percent in those getting the drug, Dupilumab, compared with those getting a placebo.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/22/business/22-DRUG/22-DRUG-articleLarge.jpg", "byl": "By Andrew Pollack", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": ",Pharmaceuticals,Asthma,The New England Journal of Medicine,,Research,Sanofi,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals", "pdate": 20130521, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/business/dupilumab-a-new-drug-may-help-some-asthmatics.html", "type": "article", "title": "New Drug May Help Some Asthmatics, Study Finds", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/22/business/22-DRUG/22-DRUG-articleLarge.jpg", "alt": "Dr. George D.
