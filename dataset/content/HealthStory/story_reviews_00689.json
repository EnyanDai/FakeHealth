Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.\n\nAbbVie\u2019s three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks.\n\nAchillion\u2019s ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy.\n\nThe main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy.\n\nMonday\u2019s data shows Achillion\u2019s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said.\n\nThe question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair\u2019s Katherine Xu said.\n\nAchillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet.\n\nThe all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount.\n\nHarvoni\u2019s list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Grover", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-achillion-gilead-idUSKBN0LD16U20150209", "title": "Promising data bodes well for all-Achillion hep C treatment", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;medical-research;companies-mrch;companies-phar;everythingNews;healthNews;drug-pricing1;consolidated-business", "description": "Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc's experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc's Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment.", "Author": "Natalie Grover", "keywords": "United States,Alethia Young,Katherine Xu,Milind S.
