(No surprise since fennel seeds are known to be a natural digestive aid because they relax the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract and also help to expel gas.) Another study looked at Colimil, an herbal formula containing fennel, lemon balm, and German chamomile, which after use showed a significant difference in crying times per day.\n\nFive studies that looked at glucose and sucrose supplements found significant easing effects on colic symptoms, too.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the study is how the authors explain what many a frazzled parent already knows \u2013 that it's hard to know how to treat colic because colic itself is such a wily beast.\n\nThe difficulty in finding an effective treatment is related to our lack of understand of IC (infantile colic). Its pathophysiology is unclear; food allergies, formula intolerance, immaturity of gastrointestinal tract, excessive gas formation or intestinal cramping have all been suggested as possible etiologies. Arguably, any rational treatment should be directed at the mechanisms of the disease itself.\n\nThe study didn't include specific instructions on dosage, so check with your pediatrician before trying any herbal remedy. And, even then, don't give your baby hot tea!\n\nWhat do you do to help soothe your baby's colic?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647im_/http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/__/spinner.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647im_/http://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/abstractmartinblog/images/icons-email.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647im_/http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/av/60x60/kavita-varma-white-134830363.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647im_/https://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/today/images/favicon.ico", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647im_/http://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/abstractmartinblog/images/icons-feed.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647im_/http://log.newsvine.com/poke.gif?x=0|26&get=c6355131&rand=911457514&do=today.com&ad=30:30:159;121::;44::;28:27:108;28:27:108;30:30:159;86:86:270;87:87:209;76::"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647im_/https://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/today/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kavita Varma-White"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110424165647/http://moms.today.com/_news/2011/03/28/6355131-how-to-soothe-babys-colic-pour-a-cup-of-tea", "title": "How to soothe baby's colic?
