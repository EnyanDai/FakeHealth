Data from a second arm of the study is still being evaluated.\n\nA separate study of the drug also showed signs it could work in people who first appeared not to respond to the drug.\n\nResearchers reintroduced the drug to 32 patients who were initially treated as part of a study of 634 patients.\n\nEight of the 32 got ipilimumab alone, 23 got ipilimumab plus a vaccine called gp100, and one got the vaccine alone. All of the treatments appeared safe.\n\nThe team found that in patients whose cancer initially progressed while on ipilimumab, whose who were reintroduced to the drug had a disease control rate of 65 to 75 percent, compared to zero in the patient who got the vaccine only.\n\n\u201cThese findings may have implications for the use of ipilimumab therapy in the long-term management of advanced melanoma,\u201d the researchers reported in the abstract.\n\nMelanoma accounts for about 3 percent of skin cancer cases but causes most skin cancer deaths, and doctors have few effective treatments to offer once the disease has spread.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, melanoma accounted for more than 68,000 cases of skin cancer in 2009, and 8,650 deaths.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-drug-melanoma-idUSTRE64K64D20100521", "title": "Drug may work in melanoma tumors in brain", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "An experimental cancer drug showed early promise at helping patients with advanced melanoma that had spread to the brain, according to a summary of data from a mid-stage study.", "Author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "keywords": "Julie Steenhuysen,US,DRUG,MELANOMA", "news_keywords": "Julie Steenhuysen;US;DRUG;MELANOMA", "REVISION_DATE": "Fri May 21 21:20:04 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-05-21T21:20:04+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-drug-melanoma-idUSTRE64K64D20100521", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Drug may work in melanoma tumors in brain", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Julie Steenhuysen,US,DRUG,MELANOMA", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-DRUG-MELANOMA", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Drug may work in melanoma tumors in brain", "sailthru.author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "sailthru.date": "2010-05-21T21:20:04+0000", "sailthru.title": "Drug may work in melanoma tumors in brain", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Drug may work in melanoma tumors in brain", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-drug-melanoma-idUSTRE64K64D20100521", "type": "article", "description": "An experimental cancer drug showed early promise at helping patients with advanc...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-05-21T21:20:04+0000", "modified_time": "2010-05-21T21:20:04+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Julie Steenhuysen", "tag": "Julie Steenhuysen,US,DRUG,MELANOMA"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Drug may work in melanoma tumors in brain", "description": "An experimental cancer drug showed early promise at helping patients with advanced melanoma that had spread to the brain, according to a summary of data from a mid-stage study.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1274476804.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
