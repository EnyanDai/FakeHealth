Some detected tumors do not become dangerous, and some treatments have harmful side effects.\n\nRegular screenings prevented one death per 1,904 women screened from age 40 to 49. The panel also said women ages 50 to 74 needed mammograms only every two years instead of every year.\n\nMany doctors responded that early detection is key and that no tool is better for earliest detection than the mammogram.\n\nThe question at hand, Hardesty said, is: \u201cIf it\u2019s your cancer, and your life, it\u2019s huge, but where are we willing to spend that money?\u201d\n\nResearchers immediately started recording changes caused by the revised guidelines. Hardesty\u2019s patient study started with the fact that 1,327 women in the 40-49 age group sought mammograms at University Hospital in a nine-month period before the guidelines; afterward, the numbers dropped by 205.\n\nThe recession and loss of work-based insurance might explain some decline, Hardesty said, but women in the 50-74 age group had a slight increase.\n\nHealth care cost-reform efforts depend in part on increased funding for evidence-based treatment reviews, which evaluate the effectiveness of everything from antibiotics to spinal procedures to prostate screening.\n\nBut guidelines lead to fears that insurers or governments won\u2019t pay for certain tests and procedures \u2014 words such as \u201crationing\u201d stirred the 2009-10 federal reform debate.\n\n\u201cWe want to have the best science out there. We want to have evidence-based practices, but I think this has caused more damage than good,\u201d said Michele Ostrander, executive director of the Denver branch of Susan G. Komen for the Cure.\n\nThe revised guidelines \u201cdidn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t get a mammogram,\u2019 but that\u2019s what the public heard,\u201d according to the new research, Ostrander said.\n\nColorado advocates said they had not seen evidence that payers were trying to cut out mammograms after the study. The state legislature passed a law last year requiring Colorado insurers to pay for mammograms every year past age 40.\n\nThe cancer-treatment community will watch closely for more studies, said Dr. Colleen Murphy, director of the breast-cancer program at Porter Adventist Hospital.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t met too many providers who think these guidelines are a good idea,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cHopefully there will be more research that supports that side of things.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/denverpost.jpg", "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/denverpost.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Booth", "Michael Booth Was A Health Care", "Health Policy Writer At The Denver Post Before Departing In He Started His Journalism Career As An Assistant Foreign Editor At The Washington Post Before Moving With Family To Denver", "Taking A Brief Stint With The Denver Business Journal.
