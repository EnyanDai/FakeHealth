An approval for Crohn\u2019s would give the drug entry into an estimated $1.3 billion U.S. market and $2.7 billion market worldwide.\n\nThe intravenous biotech drug met the primary goal of the study as almost 40 percent of patients who received the 6 milligrams per kilogram of weight dose of Stelara achieved a clinical response \u2014 defined as a 100-point reduction in the Crohn\u2019s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) \u2014 after six weeks of treatment.\n\nThat compared with a response rate of 23.5 percent of patients who received a placebo.\n\nTwo lower doses of Stelara were also tested in the study of 526 patients with moderate to severe Crohn\u2019s disease who were not helped by, or could not tolerate, treatment with a widely used class of drugs known as TNF antagonists, such as Abbott Laboratories\u2019 Humira.\n\nThose who received 1 mg/kg had a 36.6 percent response rate and the 3 mg/kg dose led to a 34.1 percent response rate.\n\n\u201cTo see these kind of outcomes, where you have high response rates in the short term and then good remission rates out toward five or six months of therapy, it shows unequivocally that the drug is effective for treating Crohn\u2019s disease,\u201d said Dr. William Sandborn, the study\u2019s lead investigator, who presented the data at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in Chicago on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effective in the patient population that has the greatest unmet need at this point in time,\u201d Sandborn said of patients who do not respond to anti-TNF drugs.\n\nHe said a 100-point drop in the CDAI was clinically meaningful to patients. \u201cThey\u2019ll feel measurably better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe patient population was really quite ill and had very high disease activity, and despite that we saw nice response rates,\u201d Sandborn said.\n\nIn a second phase of the study, those who responded to Stelara after six weeks of treatment were given either a 90-mg injection of Stelara at week eight and week 16 or a placebo.\n\nAfter 22 weeks, 69.4 percent of the Stelara patients maintained a clinical response and 41.7 percent were deemed to be in clinical remission. That compared with 42.5 percent who maintained a clinical response and a 27.4 percent remission rate in the placebo group.\n\nClinical remission was defined as a CDAI score down to 150. Patients in the study on average started at 320 or 325 on the CDAI scale, researchers said.\n\nCrohn\u2019s is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects an estimated 700,000 Americans. Common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea, and it can lead to bowel perforations. Many Crohn\u2019s patients require surgery when medicines no longer control symptoms.\n\nThe rate of infections and other serious side effects was similar in the Stelara and placebo groups, researchers said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll need more patients and longer-term data to really fully characterize the safety profile in Crohn\u2019s disease, but so far so good,\u201d Sandborn said.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Berkrot", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jj-crohns-idUSTRE7472K220110508", "title": "Crohn's patients respond to J&J's Stelara in study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "Johnson & Johnson's Stelara helped a significantly higher percentage of Crohn's disease sufferers than those who received a placebo, according to a study of patients who had not been helped by other commonly used drugs.", "Author": "Bill Berkrot", "keywords": "US,JJ,CROHNS", "news_keywords": "US;JJ;CROHNS", "REVISION_DATE": "Sun May 08 21:46:26 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-05-08T21:46:26+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Bill Berkrot", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jj-crohns-idUSTRE7472K220110508", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Crohn's patients respond to J&J's Stelara in study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,JJ,CROHNS", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-JJ-CROHNS", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Crohn's patients respond to J&J's Stelara in study", "sailthru.author": "Bill Berkrot", "sailthru.date": "2011-05-08T21:46:26+0000", "sailthru.title": "Crohn's patients respond to J&J's Stelara in study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Crohn's patients respond to J&J's Stelara in study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jj-crohns-idUSTRE7472K220110508", "type": "article", "description": "Johnson & Johnson's Stelara helped a significantly higher percentage of Cro...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-05-08T21:46:26+0000", "modified_time": "2011-05-08T21:46:26+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Bill Berkrot", "tag": "US,JJ,CROHNS"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Crohn's patients respond to J&J's Stelara in study", "description": "Johnson & Johnson's Stelara helped a significantly higher percentage of Crohn's disease sufferers than those who received a placebo, according to a study of patients who had not been helped ...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1304827200.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
