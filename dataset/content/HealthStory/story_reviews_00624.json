Carroll answered readers\u2019 questions about this article in a follow-up here.\n\nWhen I was a kid, my parents refused to let me drink coffee because they believed it would \u201cstunt my growth.\u201d It turns out, of course, that this is a myth. Studies have failed, again and again, to show that coffee or caffeine consumption are related to reduced bone mass or how tall people are.\n\nCoffee has long had a reputation as being unhealthy. But in almost every single respect that reputation is backward. The potential health benefits are surprisingly large.\n\nWhen I set out to look at the research on coffee and health, I thought I\u2019d see it being associated with some good outcomes and some bad ones, mirroring the contradictory reports you can often find in the news media. This didn\u2019t turn out to be the case.\n\nJust last year, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies looking at long-term consumption of coffee and the risk of cardiovascular disease was published. The researchers found 36 studies involving more than 1,270,000 participants. The combined data showed that those who consumed a moderate amount of coffee, about three to five cups a day, were at the lowest risk for problems. Those who consumed five or more cups a day had no higher risk than those who consumed none.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/08/upshot/11UP-Health/11UP-Health-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/08/upshot/11UP-Health/11UP-Health-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/08/upshot/11UP-Health/11UP-Health-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aaron E.
