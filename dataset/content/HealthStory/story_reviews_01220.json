Both of these vaccines are recommended to prevent cervical cancers. These vaccines are now on the CDC\u2019s routine childhood vaccine schedule for girls starting at age 9.\n\nThe Gardasil vaccine has also received FDA approval for prevention of genital warts. The vaccine is recommended for optional use in boys and men. The vaccine is used in girls and boys and young adults ages 9 to 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11.\n\n\u201cThe most salient message is that the [Gardasil] vaccine can prevent HPV infection on the external genital region, which means that we can now prevent most cases of genital warts if the boy is vaccinated at a sufficiently early age,\u201d says study researcher Joel Palefsky, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.", "images":
