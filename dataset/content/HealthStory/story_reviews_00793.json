And half of them happen in the first month, says researcher Andreas Gille, MD, PhD. Gille is head of clinical and translational science strategy at CSL Limited (which funded the study) in Parkville, Australia.\n\nStandard heart attack medications, such as aspirin and anti-clotting drugs, prevent clotting but don\u2019t eliminate an underlying factor: cholesterol that has built up on artery walls, he says.\n\nHDL removes cholesterol from artery walls, but current HDL-boosting drugs, such as niacin and fibrates, take years to work, according to Gille.", "images":
