Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.\n\nThe study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/science/02PROSTATE/02PROSTATE-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/science/02PROSTATE/02PROSTATE-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/science/02PROSTATE/02PROSTATE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Grady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/health/prostate-cancer-hormone-blockers.html", "title": "Hormone Blockers Can Prolong Life if Prostate Cancer Recurs", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-02-01T22:11:23.000Z", "modified": "2017-02-01T22:11:22.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/denise-grady", "tag": "Zietman, Anthony L", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004904657, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/94249140-8301-51d7-b2f6-40708717e376", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/78c8fb7f2477479d94edf2419530d63c", "description": "Men whose prostate cancer recurs after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they take drugs to block male hormones.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/science/02PROSTATE/02PROSTATE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Denise Grady", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/science/02PROSTATE/02PROSTATE-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Prostate cancer,PSA,The New England Journal of Medicine,William U Shipley,Anthony L Zietman", "pdate": 20170201, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/health/prostate-cancer-hormone-blockers.html", "type": "article", "title": "Hormone Blockers Can Prolong Life if Prostate Cancer Recurs", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/science/02PROSTATE/02PROSTATE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Radiation therapists planned treatment for a patient with prostate cancer.
