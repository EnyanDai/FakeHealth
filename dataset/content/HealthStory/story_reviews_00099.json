The test detects only three out of more than 1,000 known BRCA mutations. That accounts for a small percentage of people. Those most at risk of developing such cancers are of Eastern European Jewish descent.\n\n\u201cThe test should not be used as a substitute for seeing your doctor for cancer screenings or counseling on genetic and lifestyle factors that can increase or decrease cancer risk,\u201d he said.\n\nThese tests might help with prevention, but cannot diagnose cancer and cannot rule out your chances of getting cancer, 23andMe said.\n\nStill, the company, which already tests DNA for other health risks as well as ancestry, said this cancer test is \"a step in the right direction.\"\n\nFollow Ashley May on Twitter: @AshleyMayTweets", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/11/09/USAT/71bf8e18-be3f-4b7b-a869-fb4bbd14f34b-65611019-131a-4c3a-a54e-b87eece97874_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1abbac059a7e6f21ff3aa7e38760a41a48819119/c=0-217-2118-1414/local/-/media/2018/03/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636560071434423354-GettyImages-912389900.jpg?width=2118&height=1197&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1abbac059a7e6f21ff3aa7e38760a41a48819119/c=0-217-2118-1414/local/-/media/2018/03/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636560071434423354-GettyImages-912389900.jpg?width=660&height=374&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1abbac059a7e6f21ff3aa7e38760a41a48819119/c=0-217-2118-1414/local/-/media/2018/03/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636560071434423354-GettyImages-912389900.jpg?width=2118&height=1197&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/07/new-home-fda-approved-breast-cancer-test-looks-dna-gene-mutations-increased-risk-test-risk-breast-ca/402406002/", "title": "Test risk of breast cancer from home with new FDA-approved DNA kit by 23andMe", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Test risk of breast cancer from home with new FDA-approved DNA kit by 23andMe", "description": "By analyzing DNA collected through a saliva sample, the test detects\u00a0increased risk of developing breast, ovarian or prostate cancer.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/03/07/new-home-fda-approved-breast-cancer-test-looks-dna-gene-mutations-increased-risk-test-risk-breast-ca/402406002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1abbac059a7e6f21ff3aa7e38760a41a48819119/c=0-217-2118-1414/local/-/media/2018/03/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636560071434423354-GettyImages-912389900.jpg?width=2118&height=1197&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2118, "height": 1197}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Ashley May", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "By analyzing DNA collected through a saliva sample, the test detects\u00a0increased risk of developing breast, ovarian or prostate cancer.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1abbac059a7e6f21ff3aa7e38760a41a48819119/c=0-217-2118-1414/local/-/media/2018/03/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636560071434423354-GettyImages-912389900.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Test risk of breast cancer from home with new FDA-approved DNA kit by 23andMe", "description": "By analyzing DNA collected through a saliva sample, the test detects\u00a0increased risk of developing breast, ovarian or prostate cancer."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520398800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
