There are an estimated three million unplanned pregnancies a year in the U.S., often because of incorrect or inconsistent use of contraception, and about 1.2 million abortions, according to research cited with the study.\n\nThe Contraceptive Choice project is being run by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The study was funded by the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, a charity of Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\n\nThe study found that long-acting contraception is about 20 times more effective at preventing pregnancy than pills, patches or vaginal rings because those methods \"wipe out the human error factor,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Peipert, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University. \"IUDs and implants are more effective because women can forget about them after clinicians put the devices in place.\"\n\nFailure rates for such methods are less than 1% but they require an office procedure and can cost patients several hundred dollars if not paid for by insurance, doctors said.\n\nHormonal implants are inserted under the skin of the upper arm and are effective for three years. IUDs are inserted into the uterus and last five or 10 years, depending on the type. IUDs and implants can be removed if women want to try to become pregnant. Dr. Peipert said fertility returns immediately in most women.\n\nBirth control pills are the most commonly used contraceptive in the U.S., but women need to take the pills daily for them to be fully effective. Other studies have shown that many women\u2014especially teenagers\u2014miss two or more pills per menstrual cycle, which cuts the effectiveness at preventing pregnancy. The study also included a hormone-based shot that can be given to women every three months to prevent pregnancy.\n\nThe study showed pregnancy\u2014or failure rates\u2014among participants who used the pill, patch, or ring were 4.8%, 7.8% and 9.4% in years one, two and three of the study respectively, while the failure rates in those using IUDs or implants were all below 1% during the same period. Failure rates for women receiving the three-month hormone shot also were less than 1%.\n\nDr. Peipert said he hopes the results prompt more women and doctors who counsel women on birth control to consider IUDs and implants because it could greatly reduce unintended pregnancies. \"If there were a drug for cancer, heart disease or diabetes that was 20 times more effective we would recommend it first,\" he said.\n\nDr. Erika Banks, director of gynecology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., said, \"For a woman who wants to get pregnant in a short period of time, it may not be worth the cost of having a long-acting method placed.\" Dr. Banks, who wasn't involved in the study, added that some insurance plans will only cover pills, patches or vaginal rings.\n\nStill, she said, the long-acting methods can be an \"excellent\" option for young women who don't want to become pregnant for several years.\n\nDr. Peipert trains doctors on how to implant a contraceptive device made by Merck & Co. and Washington University receives fees from the company, according to the New England Journal of Medicine article.\n\nThe Contraceptive Choice study involves women who were between ages 14 and 45 who initially weren't using contraception or wanted to switch birth-control methods, from August 2007 through last September. The women also said they didn't want to become pregnant for the next 12 months.\n\nWrite to Jennifer Corbett Dooren at jennifer.corbett-dooren@dowjones.com", "images":
