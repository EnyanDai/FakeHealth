However, a similar approach might work for some other mutations.\n\nDuchenne, which affects as many as 15,000 Americans, mainly boys and young men, is the most severe common form of muscular dystrophy, a disease made more prominent by years of Jerry Lewis telethons. Those with the disease make barely any dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscles to function. Patients typically lose the ability to walk as teenagers and die by age 30.\n\nWhile steroids, which reduce inflammation, can slow progression of the disease, they have undesirable side effects. Eteplirsen, which Sarepta says has shown no side effects so far, is vying with a similar drug being developed by GlaxoSmithKline to become the first medicine that works by directly countering the cause of the disease.\n\nEteplirsen could also be the first drug to reach the market for Sarepta since it was founded 32 years ago. It changed its name recently from AVI BioPharma to distance itself from its underachieving past.\n\nPhoto\n\nShares of Sarepta nearly tripled on Wednesday, closing at $44.93. And the stock had already roughly quadrupled since July, when Sarepta announced some interim results from the study.\n\nThe study measured how far the boys could walk in six minutes. Those who received the higher dose walked an average of 21 meters farther after 48 weeks of treatment than at the beginning of the trial, a gain of about 5 percent. The boys in the placebo group walked 68 fewer meters at the end than at the beginning, a decline of about 17 percent.\n\nOne possible reason for skepticism is that two of the boys on a lower dose of the drug rapidly lost the ability to walk, even though the level of dystrophin in their muscles increased substantially.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

That could make it harder for the Sarepta to win approval for the drug based only on this small trial, something the company hopes to do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cIf you wait and require this company to do another two-year study, a lot of these boys are going to be in a wheelchair,\u201d Christopher Garabedian, the Sarepta chief executive, said in an interview.\n\nPatient groups may also put some pressure on the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug quickly. But some also want Sarepta to make the drug available to more patients on a compassionate basis even before approval.\n\nTen-year-old Max Leclaire of Saxtons River, Vt., who has been receiving the highest dose in the trial, can now walk up stairs without having to pull himself up by the handrail, according to his mother, Jenn McNary. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer riding the handicap bus to school,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ms. McNary said Sarepta had refused to provide the drug to Max\u2019s 13-year-old brother, Austin, who could not be in the trial because he already could not walk.\n\nMr. Garabedian said Sarepta did not have the money or the manufacturing capacity to make the drug available outside of clinical trials. \u201cThat would be the quickest path to insolvency,\u201d he said.\n\nIf eteplirsen gets to market, it would come nearly three decades after the 1986 discovery of the gene responsible for Duchenne. It would also represent a success, after decades of setbacks, for the technology eteplirsen uses, called antisense, which is a way of turning off specific genes.\n\nEteplirsen actually turns off just one part of the dystrophin gene, known as exon 51, which contains a mutation that in some patients stops production of dystrophin. By skipping over this exon, muscle cells can produce an imperfect form of dystrophin that nonetheless is at least partly functional.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Drug/Drug-superJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Drug/Drug-jumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Drug/Drug-superJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/business/drug-shows-promise-in-treating-type-of-muscular-dystrophy.html", "title": "Drug Shows Promise in Treating a Type of Muscular Dystrophy in Boys", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001822993", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/business/drug-shows-promise-in-treating-type-of-muscular-dystrophy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/business/drug-shows-promise-in-treating-type-of-muscular-dystrophy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000001822993"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/business/drug-shows-promise-in-treating-type-of-muscular-dystrophy.html", "title": "Drug Shows Promise in Treating a Type of Muscular Dystrophy in Boys", "description": "An experimental drug appears to preserve and possibly even improve the ability of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to walk, but there are caveats.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Drug/Drug-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Drug Shows Promise in Treating a Type of Muscular Dystrophy in Boys", "description": "An experimental drug appears to preserve and possibly even improve the ability of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to walk, but there are caveats.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 100000001822993, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Drug Shows Promise in Treating a Type of Muscular Dystrophy in Boys", "pdate": 20121003, "utime": 20140825145907, "ptime": 20121003102447, "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 3, 2012", "dat": "Oct. 3, 2012", "lp": "An experimental drug appears to preserve and possibly even improve the ability of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to walk, but there are caveats.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "04drug", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "published": "2012-10-03T10:24:47-04:00", "modified": "2014-08-25T14:59:07-04:00", "section": "Business Day", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "top-level-section": "business", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrew-pollack", "tag": "Sarepta Therapeutics Inc."}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/business/drug-shows-promise-in-treating-type-of-muscular-dystrophy.html", "type": "article", "title": "Drug Shows Promise in Treating a Type of Muscular Dystrophy in Boys", "description": "An experimental drug appears to preserve and possibly even improve the ability of boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy to walk, but there are caveats.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Drug/Drug-superJumbo.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Andrew Pollack", "tone": "news", "byl": "By ANDREW POLLACK", "PT": "article", "CG": "business", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Muscular Dystrophy", "org": "Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.", "keywords": "Clinical Trials,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Muscular Dystrophy,Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Drug/Drug-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Drug/Drug-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1349323200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
