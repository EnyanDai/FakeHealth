After age and sex, the two best predictors of whether the patient would be alive in ten years was how highly activated their metabolism was and how fast their heart would beat during the test.\n\nMetabolism was calculated using \"metabolic equivalent of tasks\" or METs, a measure of how much energy someone expends during a task. The higher MET level achieved, the more likely it was the subject would last another decade.\n\nThe closer someone came to reaching their maximum heart rate as they ran, the less likely they were to die within ten years, compared to someone who only reached about 85 percent of their maximum heart rate during the test. Maximum heart rate was determined by subtracting the subject\u2019s age from 220, a formula that\u2019s been used for decades by exercisers and doctors alike.\n\nDr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News medical contributor, explained the science behind the test on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\u201cIn medicine we usually base predictions of survival on the absence or presence of a disease state,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s new here is that there is now a fancy equation doctors can use to compare the chances of survival for one 50-year-old woman against another 50-year-old woman.\u201d\n\nRather than being viewed as morbid, experts should be able to use this information to motivate people to change their behavior, Ashton said. Everyone can improve their survival score by exercising more often and pushing it a little harder when they do, she added.\n\n\u201cThis is in your power to change and improve your numbers. You can actually change your own destiny,\u201d she said.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY_treadmill_jef_150302_12x5_992.jpg", "http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY_treadmill_jef_150302_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY_treadmill_jef_150302_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Liz Neporent"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/treadmill-test-predicts-survival-fittest/story?id=29331839", "title": "How a New Treadmill Test Predicts 'Survival of the Fittest'", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A simple treadmill test can help predict how long you will live.", "keywords": "treadmill, treadmill stress test, Good Morning America, health, exercise, physical activity, fitness,health news, medical news, medical articles", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2015-03-03T10:58:03:530-08", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "New Treadmill Test Predicts 'Survival of the Fittest'", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "New Treadmill Test Predicts 'Survival of the Fittest'", "description": "A simple treadmill test can help predict how long you will live.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/treadmill-test-predicts-survival-fittest/story?id=29331839", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY_treadmill_jef_150302_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "treadmill, treadmill stress test, Good Morning America, health, exercise, physical activity, fitness", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "@lizzyfit", "title": "New Treadmill Test Predicts 'Survival of the Fittest'", "description": "A simple treadmill test can help predict how long you will live.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/treadmill-test-predicts-survival-fittest/story?id=29331839", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/GTY_treadmill_jef_150302_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,29331839", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,29331839", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/treadmill-test-predicts-survival-fittest/story?id=29331839"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,29331839", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,29331839", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/treadmill-test-predicts-survival-fittest/story?id=29331839", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/treadmill-test-predicts-survival-fittest/story?id=29331839"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
