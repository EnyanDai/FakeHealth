REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were up 25 percent at $5.26 in mid-day trading on heavy volumes.\n\nShares of BioTime Inc, a company that owns nearly 70 percent of Asterias, were little changed at $3.07.\n\nThe therapy, AST OPC-1, is the first product derived from human embryos to be tested on humans.\n\nIts success is a key step toward proving that embryonic stem cell research could cure diseases such as cancer, Parkinson\u2019s and serious health conditions such immune deficiencies, stroke and spinal injuries.\n\nData showed that the severity of the spinal injury was reduced in the first patient and two other patients were able to resume their rehabilitation programs soon after being injected with the stem cells.\n\nThe early study tested the benefits of a smaller dose of 2 million stem cells that are tuned to develop into nerves.\n\nAsterias bought OPC-1 in 2013 from the erstwhile stem cell research leader Geron Corp, which decided to focus on developing cancer drugs.\n\nGeron chose to abandon its stem cell therapy in 2011 after such research got embroiled in the abortion debate, prompting many biotech companies to stay quiet about their research.\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement was the first about the therapy in more than two years.\n\nIn an early-stage study conducted by Geron, the therapy showed potential in repairing spinal injury in four of the five patients tested, without any adverse events.\n\nAsterias is looking to show recovery of mobility in four out of every 10 patients treated with OPC-1, compared with two out of 10 achieving the same level of improvement without any treatment, Chief Executive Pedro Lichtinger told Reuters in early August.\n\nMenlo Park, California-based Asterias expects to release complete safety data from the first half of the study later in the year.\n\nLichtinger said he was confident the data would be positive but was not expecting miracles.\n\n\u201cIt is important to know that we do not expect patients to get up and play basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do expect the patients to have significant improvements in mobility.\u201d\n\nNearly 30,000 Asterias\u2019s shares were traded by 12:30 p.m. ET, or more than twice their 25-day average trading volume.", "images":
