These are the most common type of stroke. Men who had the highest lycopene levels were 59% less likely to have this kind of stroke than men with the lowest levels. The findings appear in the Oct. 9, 2012, issue of Neurology.\n\nThe new study included slightly more than 1,000 men from Finland aged 46 to 65. Researchers measured the level of lycopene in their blood when the study began and followed the men for about 12 years. During that time, 67 men had a stroke.\n\n\u201cThis study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,\u201d says researcher Jouni Karppi, PhD, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. \u201cThe results support the recommendation that people get more than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, which would likely lead to a major reduction in the number of strokes worldwide, according to previous research.\u201d\n\nOther studies have shown that high lycopene levels may be linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers. Cooked tomatoes tend to have a greater effect on blood levels of lycopene than raw tomatoes or tomato juice. Tomatoes are not the only food that is rich in this antioxidant. Other sources include pink grapefruit, watermelon, and guava.", "images":
