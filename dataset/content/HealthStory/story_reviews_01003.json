{"url": "http://www.latimes.com/health/la-he-skeptic-testosterone-supplements-20110912,0,111750.story", "text": "Age is just a number. But for men, that number says a lot about what\u2019s going on in their bodies. Starting at about age 30, men start producing less testosterone, the hormone that helps spark sex drive, build muscle and stoke energy, ambition and aggression. In short, it helps men feel manly.\n\nFor all of the talk about \u201cmale menopause,\u201d the loss of testosterone isn\u2019t anything like the hormonal nose dive that women go through. Instead of essentially disappearing all at once, testosterone levels usually decline by about 1% every year (although they can drop more dramatically, especially if a man becomes ill).\n\nMen diagnosed with unusually low levels of testosterone are sometimes treated with prescription testosterone injections, patches or creams. Men who want to regain the levels of their younger days without a prescription may be interested in a different route: over-the-counter products that promise to boost testosterone naturally.\n\nTestoJack 100, a supplement from NOW Foods, contains a blend of herbs, including Eleutherococcus senticosus, Tribulus terrestris and Eurycoma longifolia, along with zinc, magnesium and vitamin B-6, among other ingredients. Users are instructed to take two capsules once or twice a day. It\u2019s available at many health-food stores, and you can expect to pay roughly $20 to $30 for a bottle of 60 capsules.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHGH Up, a widely available supplement from Applied Nutriceuticals, contains, among other ingredients, the herbs Chlorophytum borivillanium, Mucuna pruriens and Huperzia serrata, along with green tea, magnesium and a vitamin B complex. Users are instructed to take five capsules every day on an empty stomach \u2014 three in the morning and two in the afternoon. A bottle of 150 capsules costs about $60.\n\nThe claims\n\nThe NOW website says TestoJack \u201csupports male reproductive function and healthy testosterone levels.\u201d The tribulus in the product is said to be especially helpful for \u201cvirility.\u201d Despite the suggestive name of the product, NOW doesn\u2019t claim that TestoJack actually increases testosterone, says Neil Levin, the company\u2019s nutrition education manager. \u201cIt supports healthy testosterone levels,\u201d he says.\n\nAccording to the label, HGH Up \u201cpromotes radical increases in growth hormone and testosterone production.\u201d The website says that it can provide \u201cthe physiological benefits comparable to that of fully hormonal products while minimizing potential side effects.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the product is marketed mainly to weightlifters and bodybuilders, it has a growing following among older men looking for rejuvenation, says Don Orrell, president of Applied Nutriceuticals. \u201cFor an older man who has low testosterone, there is absolutely no downside to taking this,\u201d he says.\n\nOrrell notes that the way in which the product boosts testosterone is a bit of a mystery \u2014 \u201cthat\u2019s the magic pixie dust part,\u201d he says \u2014 but he has no doubt that it works. \u201cThe anecdotal evidence is overwhelming,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nDr. John Morley, a testosterone expert and director of geriatrics at St. Louis University, says that there\u2019s not a lot of scientific evidence for any supplement that claims to boost or \u201cpromote\u201d testosterone. And for him, that\u2019s a real problem.\n\n\u201cThese sorts of products have been around forever,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as I know, none of them have been proven to work in a carefully controlled trial.\u201d\n\nSome of the individual ingredients in these products have been tested, with less-than-impressive results. In a 2007 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, Australian researchers found that giving rugby players daily doses of Tribulus terrestris for five weeks had no effect on their testosterone levels.\n\nChlorophytum, one of the ingredients in HGH Up, has long been used as a supposed aphrodisiac for men. A search of the medical literature uncovers a single study suggesting that it may have \u201ctestosterone-like\u201d effects, including enhanced sex drive and stronger erections, but the study was conducted on rats, not humans.\n\nMorley often prescribes testosterone for men who have a significant deficit of the hormone, a condition called hypogonadism. The prevalence of this condition is controversial \u2014 it depends on how one measures testosterone and defines normal levels \u2014 but Morley estimates that 30% to 40% of middle-aged men don\u2019t have enough testosterone to feel their best, sexually and otherwise. Even among these men, about one-third don\u2019t respond to testosterone treatment. In other words, testosterone is hardly a sure-fire remedy against the ravages of aging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver-the-counter testosterone products may carry hidden dangers. A 2008 study in Clinical Cancer Research found that two men taking a supplement called Teston-6 developed unusually aggressive, fast-growing prostate cancer. Lab tests showed that the product contained hormones (including testosterone) that weren\u2019t on the label, a common issue with nonprescription products. The manufacturer quickly pulled it from the market.\n\n\u201cThe problem with these sorts of supplements is that they don\u2019t have to meet the regulations of the Food and Drug Administration,\u201d says Dolores Lamb, a coauthor of the Teston-6 study and professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nA man who thinks he\u2019s short on testosterone shouldn\u2019t be looking in a health food store for answers, Morley says. \u201cHe needs to go to a doctor to get checked out.\u201d\n\nCurious about a consumer health product?
