The firm, which markets itself as \u201cThe Women\u2019s Health Company,\u201d makes other products, including a 2-D digital mammography machine, a test that assesses risk of preterm labor, gynecological products, including Adiana (a permanent contraception technique), and widely used equipment that measures bone density. But 3-D mammography could become its flagship, because for the moment it owns the entire market \u2013 although other companies, including powerhouse GE, are developing their own 3-D machines, Hologic is the only one with FDA approval thus far. Of course, given the sluggish economy and the continuing state of uncertainty around American health care, persuading hospitals to upgrade may be challenging. So perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that the company\u2019s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase \u201chuge breakthrough,\u201d or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography \u2013 Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor \u2013 did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February.\n\nIndeed they do. They\u2019re catching on like \u2013 well, it\u2019s not a slow burn. The device earned Food and Drug Administration approval on February 11, and for a short time it was available only at MGH. Now it is available in at least nine states, three of which have multiple sites, and most of the several dozen hospitals around the United States that assisted with clinical trials are planning to buy systems, too. The images aren\u2019t the only selling point. The early data are compelling as well. In studies presented to the FDA, radiologists reported a 7 percent improvement in their ability to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous cases when they used the new system. If that sounds unimpressive, consider that 39 million women are screened each year; any significant reduction in callbacks for additional testing would mean hundreds of thousands of women would be spared painful, and expensive, follow-up.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Rafferty is trying not to lapse into rhapsodic cliches. \u201cI don\u2019t want to call it a magic bullet, because that would oversell,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea.\u201d Then, five minutes later: \u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s catching on like wildfire.\u201d After a few minutes more, though, Rafferty can\u2019t help herself. She lets her enthusiasm loose. \u201cPeople have been waiting for it for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a step, but it\u2019s a step by a person who has a stride of 7 feet.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d is a 3-D mammography machine, the Selenia Dimensions system, one of which sits in the breast imaging clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital that Rafferty, a radiologist, runs. The machine, which is made by the Bedford company Hologic and developed partly at MGH under Rafferty\u2019s supervision, produces images that are so vivid and clear they seem to speak out loud: \u201cHey, right here! This is a tumor!\u201d If you look at enough of them, you may become convinced that you don\u2019t need medical training to spot a case of breast cancer or distinguish a false positive on a mammogram from a true one. The distinction seems that clear. \u201cIf you can tell the difference as a non-radiologist, imagine how a radiologist feels,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cThe images sort of sell themselves.\u201d\n\nMuch of the criticism focused on the data the task force had used to make its decision, which consisted largely of the results from prospective, randomized clinical trials conducted in the United States. Trials like this are the gold standard of medical evidence. They are also expensive and time-consuming, and thus hard to come by. The most recent such trial looking at mammography and mortality in the United States was published in the 1980s. \u201cA lot of the people on the task force are my friends, and I have tremendous respect for them, but this was a big point where we differed,\u201d says Brawley. \u201cThe standard type of mammography that\u2019s used all over the country today may very well be better than what was used in that trial. So the outcomes may be better, too.\u201d The studies the task force had chosen to examine showed that screening beginning at age 40 had little impact on mortality while at the same time generating a significant number of false positives. Those data were complete and comprehensive. But, says Brawley, they were outdated.\n\nThe task force wasn\u2019t expecting a firestorm. That, however, was what it got. Breast cancer advocacy groups mutinied, saying the guidelines would cause significant numbers of women to go undiagnosed for years, some of them fatally. Politicians started giving scary speeches about rationing health care. Many radiologists \u2013 including the MGH department as a whole \u2013 rejected the new guidelines. Daniel Kopans, a world leader in breast imaging (he wrote the textbook of that name) and a radiologist at MGH, now says that the panel didn\u2019t \u201cunderstand mammography screening.\u201d Furthermore, he adds, the new guidelines had \u201cno biological or scientific reason\u201d behind them.\n\nThe last time someone tried to improve the way American women are screened for breast cancer, it turned into a national debacle. In November 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed group of doctors charged with making recommendations that often influence what insurers will pay for, updated its guidelines for mammography. Previously, it had advised women to begin annual or biannual screening at 40. The new guidelines pushed that age to 50, emphasizing that starting earlier should be an individual choice.\n\nDebates about mammography are often so emotionally charged that this type of nuance goes missing. \u201cI think some of our rhetoric \u2013 medicine\u2019s in general, and also that of advocates?\u2013 has made people think that every metastatic breast cancer is a failure of the woman to get a mammogram or of a doctor to read a mammogram correctly,\u201d says Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and a professor at Emory University\u2019s School of Medicine in Atlanta. \u201cIn reality, yes, mammography does save lives \u2013 but it is far from perfect. It\u2019s not as good as many people think it is.\u201d So if the new 3-D mammography isn\u2019t perfect, just how good is it?\n\nBut the company, and the rest of us, should be careful not to overhype 3-D mammography. As Rafferty says, it\u2019s not a panacea. The technology does come with costs, financial and medical. A fully equipped 3-D machine runs on average $474,541, not including the annual service fee Hologic charges for maintenance, and even hospitals that already own an upgradeable 2-D system made by Hologic have to pay about $125,000 to get it adapted for 3-D use. There are also costs in the sense of risks: Women who get a combo 2-D and 3-D mammogram, the protocol that confers the most dramatic jump in benefits, are exposed to twice as much X-ray radiation as the norm (albeit still an amount that\u2019s under the FDA\u2019s permitted limit). And no one yet knows if the new technique will actually save lives.\n\nIs Hologic's 3-D mammography machine likely to fare better? There are reasons to think it will. Unlike MRI, which requires an injection with contrast dye and an hour in the imaging machine, it isn\u2019t an ordeal \u2013 or at least it\u2019s no worse than a conventional mammogram. (Yes, you still have to endure the dreaded clamp.) And it seems to be more effective than its most similar precursor, the 2-D digital technique. Early data from Rafferty\u2019s trial showed that the same group of women who did benefit from 2-D digital benefited even more dramatically from 3-D. (It\u2019s worth noting that this is not a small group of people. Fifty percent of women are in what the American Cancer Society considers the \u201cintermediate zone\u201d of risk, which overlaps considerably with the group that saw some benefit in DMIST.) Perhaps more important, even the women who didn\u2019t see any improvement in accuracy with 2-D get a small boost with 3-D over film. And 3-D seems to be both more sensitive and more specific \u2013 improvement in one area doesn\u2019t have to come at the cost of the other.\n\nBut when the definitive trial of 2-D digital techniques, called DMIST, was published in 2005, tracking nearly 50,000 patients, it didn\u2019t provide the answers that advocates had been expecting. Digital mammography did seem to perform more accurately than film in women who were younger than 50, women who were pre- or perimenopausal, and women with dense breast tissue. But when all women were considered as a group, that benefit disappeared. On the whole, it turned out, digital just didn\u2019t live up to the way it had been sold.\n\nWhen 2-D digital mammography was introduced in 2000, doctors hoped it would vault over those problems. (Well, most of them. The cost concern was still present: Digital mammography machines were five times as expensive as film ones.) The marketing materials suggested it already had. An ad for GE\u2019s 2-D digital system that ran during the Summer Olympics called it a \u201cmajor new breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer.\u201d Digital technology, the thinking went, would show nuances that film never could, because it could render, literally, many more shades of gray.\n\nThe problem, however, was that each time they introduced a new imaging tool for breast cancer, they found that they could not advance on one front without taking a step backward on the other. \u201cFirst there was ultrasound,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cWe did find more cancers, but we also found so many false positives that it was untenable.\u201d Then there was MRI, which had the same problem \u2013 and it was 10 times more expensive than mammography.\n\nRafferty had already been running trials of 3-D mammography for two years when the task force\u2019s guidelines came out. She understood its concern about false positives \u2013 she was trying to address it, herself, albeit in a very different way. In fact, technology developers had been trying in various ways for years to increase mammography\u2019s sensitivity (its ability to flag possible cases of cancer) while also increasing its specificity (its ability to filter out the false positives).\n\nThere\u2019s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. The technique works a little like a CT scan does; it takes 15 pictures of the breast at slightly different angles, then fuses them into a single synthesized image. If breast cancers were spherical in shape, they\u2019d look basically the same in all 15 images, or, for that matter, on a conventional 2-D picture. But they\u2019re very rarely shaped that way in reality. \u201cIn the breast, in particular, cancer cells tend to creep out single-file along the architecture of the body,\u201d says Rafferty. \u201cAnd that makes some of them especially hard to see on a [2-D] mammogram. They look like distortions, not blobs.\u201d There\u2019s another thing about cancer that is much clearer on a 3-D mammogram: spicules, or thin, spidery tentacles emerging from the center of a tumor. 2-D images, when taken from the wrong angle, are often too fuzzy to show them. In 3-D, however, the spicules are visible in high resolution \u2013 and seeing them is critical, since they are a hallmark of malignancy.\n\nTo Rafferty, the existing data are persuasive enough. \u201cI own no stock in Hologic. I have no financial ties to them. And I was skeptical of this idea at first. You think to yourself, it is that simple? That elegant?\u201d she says. \u201cBut this really does address the fundamental flaw of mammography. I want every woman to have access to this technology. I got my sisters down here when it was approved. I was like, \u2018You\u2019re all going to get this!\u2019 Because in my heart I know it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nAndy Smith, Hologic\u2019s vice president of imaging science, is similarly hopeful. \u201cIt\u2019s expected to improve the cancer detection rate. It is going to reduce the recall rate,\u201d he says, referring to suspicious findings that require women to return for follow-up tests, some of which turn out to be false alarms. \u201cAnd we will have more numbers on that within one to two years.\u201d This last part, at least, is very likely true. Mammography is heavily regulated, and clinics are required to send their recall statistics \u2013 the number of women they call back for second looks \u2013 to the federal government. The data on whether 3-D will save more lives than 2-D may not be known immediately. But they will exist.\n\nHowever, the most meaningful data \u2013 the numbers that would show whether 3-D mammography saves women\u2019s lives \u2013 won\u2019t be available for decades. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its \u201cendpoint\u201d can say for sure, and that\u2019s how long it takes to conduct one. Smith knows that that\u2019s the reality. \u201cWe are expecting a reduction in morbidity and mortality, but we won\u2019t know that for a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know, this technology has only been approved for two months.\u201d\n\nBy the time such data do come out, mammography will surely have changed again. There are already efforts to augment it with contrast dyes, to develop a complementary tool called a \u201cgamma camera,\u201d and to augment imperfect human judgment by refining computer programs that can spot tumors as well as a radiologist might.\n\nWhat this means is that the next time the US Preventive Services Task Force or anyone else wants to take a hard look at mammography, the data it has will once again be outdated. It\u2019s inevitable. Three-D mammography may very well be more accurate than 2-D. It may see more cancers and fewer impostors. But whether it\u2019s truly a \u201chuge breakthrough\u201d by the metric that matters most is a question that can\u2019t currently be answered \u2013 and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be. Rafferty may know \u201cin her heart\u201d that 3-D is better. But right now, at least, that\u2019s the only way she truly can.\n\nMary Carmichael is a member of the Globe staff.
