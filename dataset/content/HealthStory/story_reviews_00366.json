{"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/water-workout-aquatic-treadmill-hydrotherapy-exercise-trend/", "text": "Whether you call it water running, aqua jogging or hydrotherapy, you can\u2019t beat a workout in water for an array of health benefits, many experts say. Everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance.\n\nRunning and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip, knee and back injuries and surgeries. It\u2019s also an easy-on-the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis, and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill.\n\nIt\u2019s just an all-around good aerobic conditioner for athletes, too, sports medicine expert Dr. Naresh Rao, told CBS News. Rao is the Olympic Team USA Water Polo Physician for the 2016 Summer Games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function,\u201d said Rao, who is also with the department of family medicine at Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York. \u201cI personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.\u201d\n\nHydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. Another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank.\n\nMatt Johnson, a physical therapist at St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that the tank is basically a freestanding tub, about six feet long by three feet wide, with a motorized belt. The water height can be adjusted to the patient\u2019s abilities. The buoyancy of the water helps someone who\u2019s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they\u2019d be able to do on dry ground, he explained.\n\n\u201cIn water, we can teach them sooner. They can really work on their gait, walk without pain, do exercises in water that you wouldn\u2019t be able to do on land,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nA physical therapy patient at St. Luke\u2019s in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, participates in water therapy in a Hydro Track system by Conray Incorporated. Physical Therapy at St. Luke's Hospital, Bethlehem, Pa.\n\nHe uses a HydroTrack Underwater Treadmill System \u2013 professional sports teams including the New York Yankees and the Miami Dolphins, have used it, too. The nice thing about it, said Johnson, is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them. It works like a lock on a canal, he said. So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don\u2019t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.\n\nJohnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.\n\n\u201cAt waist height, it\u2019s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it\u2019s about 30 percent of body weight,\u201d Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.\n\n\u201cTaking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nA recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who\u2019d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests \u2013 one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn\u2019t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.\n\n\u201cThe study proposes a different, very innovative approach\u201d to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.\n\nWolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don\u2019t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. \u201cIt\u2019s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you\u2019re trying to do \u2013 allowing a cardio-respiratory response,\u201d Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.\n\nShe noted that medicine\u2019s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.\n\nMichael Phelps, Simone Manuel make history in Rio\n\nBudd Coates, training director at Runner\u2019s World magazine, said runners don\u2019t just plunge into water\u200b therapy when they\u2019re injured; it\u2019s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too. Some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water-safe and can be plunked right in the water.\n\nAn alternative to a water treadmill: Some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against.\n\n\u201cIt creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place,\u201d said Coates.\n\nFor those without access to a water treadmill, you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat. Some pools may loan them out, too.\n\nOr, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.\n\nIf running\u2019s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.\n\nCoates said the beauty of water running (or even walking) is that it\u2019s great for any age and any level of ability, from elderly stroke survivors to Olympic athletes.\n\nGalen Rupp, the 2016 Rio Olympics\u200b men\u2019s marathon bronze medalist, relies on it as part of his training.\n\n\u201cHe and some of the other guys on the Nike team, it\u2019s well known they take advantage of the anti-gravity treadmill and the aqua track,\u201d Coates said.", "images":
