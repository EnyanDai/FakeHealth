They cause most cases of croup and can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis \u2014 an inflammation of the small air passages in the lungs.\n\nThere is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza.\n\nFludase is already in phase 2 clinical trials for use against influenza. Adding parainfluenza to its approved indications would provide a unique and potentially large market for San Diego-based NexBio.\n\nParainfluenza uses the same receptors \u2014 molecular doorways \u2014 to infect cells as flu does. Fludase inactivates these receptors.\n\nThe researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza.\n\nThere were some weaknesses in the study. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza. And infection in rats does not follow the same disease course as in humans.\n\nMoscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals.\n\nA spokesman for NexBio, David Wurtman, said the company would seek Food and Drug Administration approval to test Fludase in people with parainfluenza.\n\nBecause Fludase affects the human cells that viruses infect, not the virus itself, it is less likely to cause the virus to develop resistance, the company believes.\n\nInfluenza viruses have already developed widespread resistance to three commonly used flu drugs \u2014 amantadine, rimantadine and Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s Tamiflu.\n\nA fourth drug, GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s and Biota Inc\u2019s Relenza, works by the same mechanism as Tamiflu.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-fludase-idUSTRE65K51C20100621", "title": "Experimental flu treatment may help related virus", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "An experimental drug being developed to fight influenza may fight a common but little-known virus called parainfluenza virus, researchers and the company said on Friday.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,FLU,FLUDASE", "news_keywords": "US;FLU;FLUDASE", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Jun 21 17:48:41 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-06-21T17:48:41+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-fludase-idUSTRE65K51C20100621", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Experimental flu treatment may help related virus", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,FLU,FLUDASE", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-FLU-FLUDASE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Experimental flu treatment may help related virus", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2010-06-21T17:48:41+0000", "sailthru.title": "Experimental flu treatment may help related virus", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Experimental flu treatment may help related virus", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-fludase-idUSTRE65K51C20100621", "type": "article", "description": "An experimental drug being developed to fight influenza may fight a common but l...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-06-21T17:48:41+0000", "modified_time": "2010-06-21T17:48:41+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,FLU,FLUDASE"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Experimental flu treatment may help related virus", "description": "An experimental drug being developed to fight influenza may fight a common but little-known virus called parainfluenza virus, researchers and the company said on Friday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1277142521.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
