Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic have a vaccine in early-stage clinical tests.\n\nThe early-stage Phase I trial of GSK\u2019s vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute, said it was \u201cencouraging\u201d that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system.\n\n\u201cThe safety profile is pretty much as we\u2019d hoped and the immune responses are okay, but not great,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nThe data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year.\n\nThe volunteers got one of three doses - low, medium, or high - and data from 28 days after vaccination showed the shot was safe at these doses, with only mild side effects.\n\n\u201cPeople typically experienced mild symptoms that lasted for one or maybe two days, such as pain or reddening at the injection site, and occasionally people felt feverish,\u201d Hill said.\n\nHowever, the antibody response was weaker than was found in a trial of the same Ebola vaccine in macaque monkeys, in which the animals were also found to be protected.\n\nHill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system\u2019s T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed.\n\nJeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided \u201cgood initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, we still don\u2019t know whether it will provide protection against Ebola infection in a real-world situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.\u201d", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png",
