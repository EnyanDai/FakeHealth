That much larger, government-funded study of hormone therapy was halted in 2002 because the risks of heart disease and stroke seemed to outweigh the benefits.\n\nThose findings had sparked concern among women who turn to hormone therapy to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. The women in the WHI were older\u2014on average 63 years old\u2014and largely a decade or more past menopause, and critics suggested women closer to menopause might get more benefit with less harm. Nevertheless, use of estrogen and progesterone in the U.S. dropped by more than half between 2001 and 2009, according to IMS Health, a health-care technology and information company.\n\nThe new study \"will be reassuring to many people who were anxious about using estrogen for short-term therapy, particularly health-care providers who were nervous about their patients taking this,\" said Mary Jane Minkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine, one of the study's eight sites.\n\nThe trial, known as Keeps, for Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, was funded by the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Phoenix that conducts research on age-related diseases.\n\nThe four-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 727 women aged 42 to 58 who were within three years of the onset of menopause. They received either a low-dose estrogen pill (one made with horse estrogen) or a skin patch (one with estradiol, made from plants but closer to what women's bodies make) or a placebo.\n\nWomen on estrogen also took a natural progesterone; the WHI used a synthetic form.\n\nNeither type of estrogen had any significant impact on blood pressure, coronary calcium levels or atherosclerosis, as measured by ultrasounds of the carotid artery\u2014key markers of cardiovascular health. Researchers speculated that was because the women were generally healthy and yet at an age where such problems are rare.\n\nWomen taking estrogen in pill form had an increase in HDL or \"good\" cholesterol, and a decrease in LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol, but an increase in triglycerides. Women on the patch had an improvement in insulin sensitivity, making them less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes.\n\nWomen on both forms of estrogen reported fewer hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings, as well as an improvement in bone density.\n\nA second branch of the study, funded by the National Institute of Aging, found that estrogen in pill form, but not the patch, improved symptoms of depression, anxiety and tension, without causing memory or cognitive ability, which the WHI had found in older women.\n\nResearchers said those findings underscored the need for women and their doctors to make individual decisions about whether to go on hormone therapy and if so, which kind.\n\n\"A woman who has low HDL cholesterol and borderline high LDL and has some mood symptoms, might find some advantages on the oral estrogen, whereas a woman who has [high risk for Type 2 diabetes], some excess weight, might benefit from the [skin patch] form,\" said JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the lead Keeps researchers. The researchers , who haven't yet submitted the findings for publication, plan more analysis on the impact of hormone therapy on breast density They also say they hope to continue monitoring the participants for any future effects on heart disease, cancer or cognitive function-whether they continue to take hormones or not.\n\nMargery Gass, executive director of the menopause society, and who wasn't involved in Keeps, said it confirmed her group's view on hormone therapy: \"There seems to be very small risks for healthy women at menopause.\" But, \"there is no strong evidence that women should be taking it long-term.\"\n\nWrite to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com", "images":
