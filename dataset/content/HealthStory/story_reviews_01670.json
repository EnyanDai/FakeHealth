He is the senior author on the study, presented at the American Association for Cancer Research-International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer's joint conference in Coronado, Calif.\n\nAbout 219,000 new cases of lung cancer were expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2009, according to the American Cancer Society, and about 159,000 deaths were expected.\n\nAccording to Dubinett, about one in 500 chest X-rays shows a lung nodule of ''indeterminant significance.\" When that occurs, the next step is to examine the suspicious area, with the physician ordering a biopsy or inserting a scope into the lungs to evaluate further.", "images":
