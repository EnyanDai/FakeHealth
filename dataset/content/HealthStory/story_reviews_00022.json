REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nTwo doses of Stelara, already approved for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease, was tested in 961 patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who had failed prior therapy.\n\nBoth 6 mg/kg and 130 mg doses of the intravenous treatment showed clinical remission in significantly more patients, compared with those on placebo, after eight weeks, the company said.\n\nThe treatment and the placebo arms reported similar proportion of side effects, with one patient on the 6 mg/kg dose dying following excessive bleeding, J&J said.\n\nThe patient had no prior history of high blood pressure or cirrhosis, the drugmaker said.\n\n\u201cMore than half of UC patients have not experienced remission with currently available treatment options,\u201d the study\u2019s lead investigator Bruce Sands said.\n\nStelara, which brought in sales of $1.34 billion in the second quarter of 2018, is also being tested in autoimmune disease lupus.\n\nUlcerative colitis, which affects about 38,000 people in the United States annually, is a chronic condition causing abdominal pain, intestinal ulcers, bloody diarrhea and weight loss.\n\nCurrent treatments include Pfizer Inc\u2019s Xelijanz, an oral treatment for adults patients with moderate-to-severe UC, and Merck & Co\u2019s Renflexis.\n\n(This story has been refilled to correct the dosage to 130 mg, not 130 mg/kg in paragraph 3)", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png",
