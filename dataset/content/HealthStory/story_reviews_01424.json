Oral Nsaids can be toxic to the kidneys, and they increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. And some, including Vioxx and Bextra, were taken off the market after they were linked to heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\u201cThe turning point for topical Nsaids was the fright over heart problems with Vioxx,\u201d Dr. Moore said. \u201cSuddenly there were tons of folks who thought topical Nsaids were a good idea.\u201d\n\nDr. Roy D. Altman, a rheumatology professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the drugs might be especially helpful for \u201cthe elderly or those taking multiple medications, who were not getting treated but who can now use topical Nsaids and get some benefit.\u201d\n\n(Dr. Altman has consulted with Novartis, which makes one of the painkillers, Voltaren gel.)\n\nAnother leading pain researcher, Dr. Roger Chou, an associate professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University, noted that the skin creams delivered \u201cvery high joint concentrations of the topical Nsaid, higher than with standard oral doses, with very low blood levels\u201d \u2014 less than 5 percent of those found with oral Nsaids.\n\nIn clinical trials, the skin creams are linked to a higher rate of redness, irritation and rash. And the three topical Nsaids sold in this country \u2014 Voltaren gel, the Flector Patch and Pennsaid, a liquid \u2014 all contain the Nsaid diclofenac, whose oral version has been linked to liver damage.\n\nThe risks in the most vulnerable population \u2014 people with other illnesses, like liver disease, or those on blood thinners \u2014 are not known, because these patients are generally excluded from studies. One analysis of 19 studies of older adults found that about 15 percent of patients had gastrointestinal complaints, although not life-threatening ones.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Gehrmann, the director of sports medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. \u201cNow that you can just write a prescription, I use them in my practice a lot more.\u201d\n\nSince the Food and Drug Administration approved the first topical Nsaid in 2007, sales in the United States have soared \u2014 to more than $264 million in 2009, according to IMS Health, a health care research company. The average copayment for a month\u2019s supply of Voltaren gel or Pennsaid is around $30.\n\n\u201cI think many people are not aware of topical Nsaids, or there is a perception that they don\u2019t work well, or people confuse topical Nsaids with other topical drugs, like the topical salicylates or capsaicin,\u201d Dr. Chou said.\n\nThe topical painkillers are not for everyone. Aside from the possible risks to people with other illnesses, the drugs are not helpful for patients with pain throughout the body, like fibromyalgia, and should not be used along with oral Nsaids.\n\nNor are they recommended for stress fractures or tendon tears, because anti-inflammatory drugs in general have been shown to slow healing of tendons and bones.\n\nAnd young, healthy patients may not want to bother with creams or gels, which have their maximum effect if applied four times a day. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to pop a pill,\u201d Dr. Altman said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut for immediate relief of my tennis-related muscle pull, the cream was handy and helpful.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laurie Tarkan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/07pain.html", "title": "Nsaids May Directly Ease Muscle and Joint Pain", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248068982524", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/07pain.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/07pain.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248068982524"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/07pain.html", "title": "Nsaids May Directly Ease Muscle and Joint Pain", "description": "Controlled trials suggest that a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in a cream is as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis, soreness and tendinitis.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive", "hdl_p": "Topical Gel Catches Up With Pills For Relief", "description": "Controlled trials suggest that a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in a cream is as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis, soreness and tendinitis.", "genre": "News", "articleid": 1248068982524, "usageTerms": "https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale", "hdl": "Nsaids May Directly Ease Muscle and Joint Pain", "pdate": 20100906, "utime": 20141006131506, "ptime": 20100906142147, "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 6, 2010", "dat": "Sept. 6, 2010", "lp": "Controlled trials suggest that a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in a cream is as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis, soreness and tendinitis.", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "cre": "The New York Times", "slug": "07pain", "article": {"collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "published": "2010-09-06T14:21:47-04:00", "modified": "2014-10-06T13:15:06-04:00", "section": "Health", "section-taxonomy-id": "7D6BE1AF-8CD8-430B-8B2A-17CD0EAA99AC", "section_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/pages/health/index.html", "top-level-section": "health", "tag": "Research"}, "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/07pain.html", "type": "article", "title": "Nsaids May Directly Ease Muscle and Joint Pain", "description": "Controlled trials suggest that a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in a cream is as effective as their oral counterparts for treating osteoarthritis, soreness and tendinitis.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170, "pages": 993603507345855}, "author": "Laurie Tarkan", "tone": "feature", "byl": "By LAURIE TARKAN", "PT": "article", "CG": "health", "PST": "News", "tom": "News", "edt": "NewYork", "des": "Research", "keywords": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals),Pain,Osteoarthritis,Arthritis and Rheumatism,Medicine and Health,Research", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1283832000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
