That means 66 people would have to get tranexamic acid to prevent one death.\n\nThat improvement may not seem so dramatic, but drug is pretty easy to give -- an initial 10-minute infusion within 8 hours of injury, followed by a second infusion over 8 hours. It doesn't cost much. And the result is a life saved.\n\nAlso, there was no difference in deaths from clots blocking blood vessels in either group, a potential safety concern for the medicine.\n\nThe results were just published online by the medical journal The Lancet.\n\nThe drug is used to reduce bleeding during surgery and is also approved in the U.S. to prevent bleeding in hemophiliacs who have teeth pulled. It works by keeping the body from breaking down clots.\n\nThe researchers recommend that \"tranexamic acid should be available to doctors treating trauma patients in all countries\" and that it be considered for the World Health Organization's roster of essential medicines.", "images": ["https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesat_sq-cbde87a2fa31b01047441e6f34d2769b0287bcd4-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/up-first.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/05/23/screen-shot-2019-05-23-at-8.46.21-am_sq-7dcea391e7a87ca3569fe3d2047dda0144e5d86f.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-light.svg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/fresh-air.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/morning-edition.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/all-things-considered.png", "https://media.npr.org/branding/sections/health-shots/branding_icon-9d5c5798fbff8351e5c796ffe65e5e8246c166fb.png", "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-logo.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/08/02/npr_planetmoney_podcasttile_sq-7b7fab0b52fd72826936c3dbe51cff94889797a0.jpg?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/08/03/npr_hiddenbrain_podcasttile_sq-270ab642de6948802f485c6ad1f087239ef6e324.jpg?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesun_sq-4a03b35e7e5adfa446aec374523a578d54dc9bf5-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-dark.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/08/03/npr_hibt_podcasttile_sq-98320b282169a8cea04a406530e6e7b957665b3f.jpg?s=100"], "top_img": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Scott Hensley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/06/15/127852843/generic-drug-could-save-thousands-of-trauma-patients", "title": "Generic Drug Could Save Many Trauma Patients", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "1VqzbDm4ukeFVHOoq5LjIKA2fVKZD-EYv8cXZhKXSfU", "robots": "noarchive,index,follow", "Rating": "General", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "date": "2010-06-15", "description": "A large international study found that an inexpensive, decades-old medicine to prevent bleeding could save many trauma patients' lives.", "og": {"title": "Generic Drug Could Save Many Trauma Patients", "url": "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2010/06/15/127852843/generic-drug-could-save-thousands-of-trauma-patients", "type": "article", "description": "A large international study found that an inexpensive, decades-old medicine to prevent bleeding could save many trauma patients' lives.", "image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400", "site_name": "NPR.org"}, "fb": {"app_id": 138837436154588, "pages": 10643211755}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Generic Drug Could Save Many Trauma Patients", "site": "@NPR", "domain": "npr.org"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1276574400.0, "source": "http://www.NPR.org", "summary": ""}
