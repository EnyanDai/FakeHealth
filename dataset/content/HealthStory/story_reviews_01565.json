Data on this drug are slated to be reviewed this summer by an FDA advisory panel. The FDA is not obligated to follow the advice of its expert panels, but it usually does.\n\nPhentermine quickly suppresses appetite, while the controlled-release topiramate decreases appetite and increases satiety throughout the day. \u201cWhen the hunger comes back, the topiramate kicks in,\u201d says study author Suzanne Oparil, MD, a professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics and director of the vascular biology and hypertension program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Topiramate also has blood pressure-lowering effects, she says. Oparil is a consultant for Qnexa manufacturer Vivus.\n\nThe new analysis of three separate studies included more than 4,500 people. Researchers compared several doses of the new pill with placebo among severely obese adults, as well as overweight, nonobese people who had other health problems related to their weight, such as high blood pressure or metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors that increase risk for diabetes and heart disease.\n\nOverall, people who took the combination pill lost more weight than their counterparts who were given a placebo. The higher the dose, the more substantial the weight loss, and the more likely it was to be maintained over time, the study shows.\n\nAt six months, people who took the full dose of Qnexa once daily lost nearly 10% of their body weight; by one year, it was up to 10.4%. Those who took the medium dose of the pill lost 8% of their body weight at six months and 8.2% by one year. The people who took the lowest dose of the drug dropped about 5.1% of body weight at six months, and, on average, gained some back by one year.", "images":
