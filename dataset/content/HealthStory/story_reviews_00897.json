It works, he says, by heating and destroying the sweat glands under the arm.\n\nThe sweating can occur even when the temperature is cool and the person is at rest. The armpits, palms, and soles are often affected.\n\nHe presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nNestor received a research grant for the study from Ulthera, which makes the technology. The study was small and the findings are preliminary.", "images":
