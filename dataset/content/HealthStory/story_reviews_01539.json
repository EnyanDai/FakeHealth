Orexin is a neuropeptide that is believed to play a key role in regulation of the brain\u2019s sleep/wake process.\n\nThe 254-patient study tested MK-4305 at 10 milligrams, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg against a placebo. The findings were presented at Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nIn the one-night measure, patients who took the highest dose of the Merck drug slept 12.2 percent more of the eight hours than those who got a placebo. The improvement was 11.6 percent at 40 mg, 6.6 percent at 20 mg and 6.2 percent at the lowest dose.\n\nAfter four weeks, when there tends to be some improvement in the placebo patients, 80 mg patients slept 7.7 percent more, while those who got the 40 mg dose slept 7.9 percent more. At 20 mg the difference was 10.4 percent and at 10 mg, 4.7 percent.\n\nMerck said it has begun separate larger Phase III studies of MK-4305 in elderly and non-elderly insomnia patients and expects to seek approval of the drug in 2012.\n\nThe company said it is testing only the 40 mg and 20 mg doses in the Phase III study among younger patients and 30 mg and 15 mg doses in the late stage trial of elderly patients.\n\n\u201cForty milligrams looked like best dose on efficacy and tolerability,\u201d said David Michelson, Merck\u2019s vice president for neuroscience clinical research. He said the 80 mg dose was likely more than most people need.\n\nPeople with insomnia may have one or more sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep and difficulty getting back to sleep after waking in the night.\n\nPatients who took the 40 mg dose in the trial spent 33 fewer minutes awake after falling asleep than the placebo group at one night and averaged 32 fewer minutes awake at the end of week four.\n\nOn average, it took patients 21.6 fewer minutes to fall asleep with the 40 mg dose of MK-4305 than a placebo on night one, Merck said.\n\nThere were no reports of serious adverse side effects. The most common side effects included upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, dizziness, drowsiness on waking, headache and vivid dreams.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by these Phase II results showing positive effects of MK-4305 in patients with primary insomnia,\u201d Michelson said in a statement.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Berkrot", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-insomnia-idUSTRE6580QA20100609", "title": "Merck drug improves sleep in insomnia study", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews", "description": "An insomnia drug being developed by Merck & Co was significantly better at improving sleep than a placebo in a mid-stage study, according to data presented on Wednesday.", "Author": "Bill Berkrot", "keywords": "US,MERCK,INSOMNIA", "news_keywords": "US;MERCK;INSOMNIA", "REVISION_DATE": "Wed Jun 09 05:08:31 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-06-09T05:08:31+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Bill Berkrot", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-insomnia-idUSTRE6580QA20100609", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Merck drug improves sleep in insomnia study", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,MERCK,INSOMNIA", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-MERCK-INSOMNIA", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Merck drug improves sleep in insomnia study", "sailthru.author": "Bill Berkrot", "sailthru.date": "2010-06-09T05:08:31+0000", "sailthru.title": "Merck drug improves sleep in insomnia study", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Merck drug improves sleep in insomnia study", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-insomnia-idUSTRE6580QA20100609", "type": "article", "description": "An insomnia drug being developed by Merck & Co was significantly better at impro...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2010-06-09T05:08:31+0000", "modified_time": "2010-06-09T05:08:31+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Bill Berkrot", "tag": "US,MERCK,INSOMNIA"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Merck drug improves sleep in insomnia study", "description": "An insomnia drug being developed by Merck & Co was significantly better at improving sleep than a placebo in a mid-stage study, according to data presented on Wednesday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage - Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Homepage", "analyticsAttributes.topicSubChannel": "Homepage", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1276060111.0, "source": "http://www.Reuters.com", "summary": ""}
