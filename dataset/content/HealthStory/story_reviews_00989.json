{"url": "http://www.Reuters.com/article/2011/10/20/us-medtronic-idUSTRE79J00L20111020", "text": "(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, has developed a device to tackle another common health problem: erectile dysfunction.\n\nThe medical device maker said it completed an initial feasibility study of 30 men, average age of 60, who suffered from erectile dysfunction (ED). After three months the results were promising, the company said.\n\nThe stent \u2014 a tiny wire mesh tube similar to those used to prop open heart arteries \u2014 was placed in the internal pudendal artery, which supplies blood to the penis.\n\nThe stent was delivered using a catheter threaded up to the pelvis, where the pudendal artery is located. It was placed in the artery, opening the vessel and allowing for better blood flow.\n\n\u201cED is largely a vascular disease and that\u2019s why Medtronic was interested in this,\u201d said Dr. Jason Rogers of UC Davis Medical Center, one of the researchers of the company-sponsored trial.\n\nThere are an estimated 30 million men in the United States who have ED and 300 million worldwide.\n\nRogers said up to 50 percent of men discontinue drug therapy \u2014 which includes Viagra, Levitra and Cialis \u2014 either because it did not work or because they could not tolerate side effects, including lowering of blood pressure.\n\nHe also noted that men who take certain drugs for heart disease cannot use the popular pills.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real unmet clinical need,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nInitial findings showed two-thirds of men who underwent the 1- to 2-hour procedure improved by at least 4 points on the 30-point Internal Index of Erectile Dysfunction scale, he said.\n\nThere were no adverse events reported up to three months later, but Rogers acknowledged that risks may become evident much later.\n\n\u201cThis is still investigational and requires more research. It is the inception of an entirely new way of treating ED that has never been seen before,\u201d he said.\n\nRogers said it could be several years before Medtronic undertakes a much larger late-stage trial.\n\nMedtronic shares gained 2.3 percent to close at $33.64 on Wednesday.", "images": ["http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-medtronic-idUSTRE79J00L20111020", "title": "Medtronic tests stent for erectile dysfunction", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthcare-upclose;companies-phar;companies-hprd;everythingNews;healthNews;consolidated-business", "description": "Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, has developed a device to tackle another common health problem: erectile dysfunction.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "United States,Jason Rogers,US,MEDTRONIC,Company News,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),General News,Advanced Medical Equipment (TRBC),Healthcare Services (TRBC),Healthcare (TRBC),Embargoed,Healthcare Equipment and Supplies (TRBC),United States", "news_keywords": "United States;Jason Rogers;US;MEDTRONIC;Company News;Health / Medicine;Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy);General News;Advanced Medical Equipment (TRBC);Healthcare Services (TRBC);Healthcare (TRBC);Embargoed;Healthcare Equipment and Supplies (TRBC);United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Oct 20 00:05:58 UTC 2011", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2011-10-20T00:05:58+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-medtronic-idUSTRE79J00L20111020", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Medtronic tests stent for erectile dysfunction", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "United States,Jason Rogers,US,MEDTRONIC,Company News,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),General News,Advanced Medical Equipment (TRBC),Healthcare Services (TRBC),Healthcare (TRBC),Embargoed,Healthcare Equipment and Supplies (TRBC),United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-MEDTRONIC", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Medtronic tests stent for erectile dysfunction", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2011-10-20T00:05:58+0000", "sailthru.title": "Medtronic tests stent for erectile dysfunction", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Medtronic tests stent for erectile dysfunction", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-medtronic-idUSTRE79J00L20111020", "type": "article", "description": "Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, ha...", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "article": {"published_time": "2011-10-20T00:05:58+0000", "modified_time": "2011-10-20T00:05:58+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "United States,Jason Rogers,US,MEDTRONIC,Company News,Health / Medicine,Biotechnology / Pharmaceuticals (Legacy),General News,Advanced Medical Equipment (TRBC),Healthcare Services (TRBC),Healthcare (TRBC),Embargoed,Healthcare Equipment and Supplies (TRBC),United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary", "title": "Medtronic tests stent for erectile dysfunction", "description": "Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, has developed a device to tackle another common health problem: erectile dysfunction.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/health/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
