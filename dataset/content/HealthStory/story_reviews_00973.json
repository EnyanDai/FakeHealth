For them, the median time before the cancer progressed was about two months.\n\n\"That time frame is not anything to write home about,\" Gulley says.\n\nOverall, however, the limited success in some patients and the complete success in one is good news, he says. \"It gives us encouragement that we may be on to something here.\"\n\nThe study, funded by the National Cancer Institute, is published in Clinical Cancer Research.", "images":
