The \"typical use\" failure rate took into account women who sometimes did not use the app correctly or may have had unprotected sex on a day when the app flagged that they were fertile.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nNatural Cycles has, however, courted controversy in Europe, as some women have reported unwanted pregnancies while using the app as their main form of birth control.\n\nSweden's public broadcasting company SVT reported that 37 out of 668 women who received an abortion at a Stockholm hospital from September 2017 to the end of December 2017 were using the app and still had an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton emphasized that no method of contraception is perfect except abstinence, so it's not completely surprising that women have still gotten pregnant while using it.\n\nAshton added that apps can be useful in that they enourage women to be aware of their bodies' monthly changes. If a woman does decide to use an app for birth control, however, she needs to have a plan for what she would do if she does have an unplanned pregnancy.\n\nMost contraception pills have a \"typical use\" failure rate of approximately 9 percent, according to Ashton, which is actually higher than the rate of the app, the FDA's data showed.\n\nStill, Asthon says that women should ask their doctors about risks, benefits and alternatives for any contraceptive method they are using.", "images": ["http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1005826543/?value=0&label=1GPKCOHYjwMQ7-PO3wM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-704476h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/woman-cell-phone-01-gty-mt-180812_hpMain_12x5_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/woman-cell-phone-01-gty-mt-180812_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/woman-cell-phone-01-gty-mt-180812_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/woman-cell-phone-03-gty-mt-180812_hpEmbed_3x2_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/natural-cycles-ht-jpo-180813_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/woman-cell-phone-01-gty-mt-180812_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/fda-approves-marketing-contraception-app-1st-time-57146537", "title": "FDA approves marketing for a contraception app for the 1st time", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2019 ABC News Internet Ventures", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Can an app be more effective than the pill?", "keywords": "app, FDA, birth control, mobile apps, U.S. Food and Drug Administration,good morning america, morning news, robin roberts, lara spencer, josh eliott, sam champion, gma", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2018-08-13T07:16:14:153-07", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "FDA approves marketing for a contraception app for the 1st time", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "title": "FDA approves marketing for a contraception app for the 1st time", "description": "Can an app be more effective than the pill?", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/fda-approves-marketing-contraception-app-1st-time/story?id=57146537", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/woman-cell-phone-01-gty-mt-180812_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "news_keywords": "app, FDA, birth control, mobile apps, U.S. Food and Drug Administration", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "title": "FDA approves marketing for a contraception app for the 1st time", "description": "Can an app be more effective than the pill?", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/fda-approves-marketing-contraception-app-1st-time/story?id=57146537", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/woman-cell-phone-01-gty-mt-180812_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,57146537", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,57146537", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/fda-approves-marketing-contraception-app-1st-time/story?id=57146537"}}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,57146537", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,57146537", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/fda-approves-marketing-contraception-app-1st-time/story?id=57146537", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Wellness/fda-approves-marketing-contraception-app-1st-time/story?id=57146537"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
