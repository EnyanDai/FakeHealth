Now, diclofenac could be a contender to help treat cancer.\n\nThe Repurposing Drugs in Oncology \u2013 ReDO \u2013 project published a clinical study this week in ecancermedicalscience that the affordable, generic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug \u2013 or NSAID \u2013 has cancer-fighting properties. While researchers already suspected NSAIDs can help prevent cancer, they're only now beginning to explore the ways that they could actually help treat the disease.\n\n\"It's still somewhat surprising that there is still so much we don't understand about how many of the standard drugs we use every day, like diclofenac, work,\" study author Pan Pantziarka, member of the ReDO project and the Anticancer Fund, said in a press release. \"But the more we learn, the more we can see that these drugs are multi-targeted agents with interesting and useful effects on multiple pathways of interest in oncology.\"\n\nPantziarka and colleagues report that diclofenac may improve the immune system, the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation and the development of blood vessels. Previous studies have shown that the drug could reduce tumor size in fibrosarcoma, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer and several other cancers, according to the press release.\n\nTreating cancer patients with diclofenac after surgery could also be beneficial, the authors wrote in the study. \"After all, it's \u200bmetastatic disease that most often kills patients, not the original primary disease,\" Pantziarka said in the release.", "images": ["https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c6acf17/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Ff0%2F24b24d7e4ae8ba65d44cd084737f%2F151005-pills-stock.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/5c365c6/2147483647/thumbnail/84x84/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2F85%2F461e2f9a4291b3ac95ab56712c28%2Fsamantha-costa.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/static/img/usn-logo-large.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c6acf17/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Ff0%2F24b24d7e4ae8ba65d44cd084737f%2F151005-pills-stock.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-01-13/common-painkiller-fights-cancer", "title": "Health Buzz: Common Painkiller Fights Cancer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Diclofenac could be the next cancer treatment.", "keywords": "Samantha Costa,headaches,cancer,aspirin,prescription drugs,NSAIDs,healthexclude [Consumer Advice],picks,Health Buzz,Wellness", "site": "healthnews", "zone": "wellness", "robots": "noindex", "fb": {"pages": 5834919267, "app_id": 130063997038366}, "og": {"title": "Health Buzz: Common Painkiller Fights Cancer", "description": "Diclofenac could be the next cancer treatment.", "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c6acf17/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Ff0%2F24b24d7e4ae8ba65d44cd084737f%2F151005-pills-stock.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "url": "https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-01-13/common-painkiller-fights-cancer"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c6acf17/2147483647/resize/1200x%3E/quality/85/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcom-usnews-beam-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Ff0%2F24b24d7e4ae8ba65d44cd084737f%2F151005-pills-stock.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@USNews", "title": "Health Buzz: Common Painkiller Fights Cancer", "description": "Diclofenac could be the next cancer treatment."}, "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "optimizely": "Optimizely is supported by this application but is not enabled for this page."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1452661200.0, "source": "http://health.usnews.com", "summary": ""}
