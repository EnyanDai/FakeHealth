These vessels are then blocked with particles the size of a grain of sand.\n\nA similar procedure is sometimes used to treat another kind of benign growth, uterine fibroids, in women.\n\n\u201cIt was my inspiration -- uterine fibroids. It\u2019s the same kind of growth,\u201d says study researcher Joao Martins Pisco, MD, chief radiologist at Hospital Pulido Valente and director of interventional radiology at St. Louis Hospital, both in Lisbon, Portugal. \u201cThe results are excellent.\u201d\n\nIn a small pilot study, most men were able to leave the hospital four to eight hours after the procedure, which is called prostatic artery embolization (PAE), researchers report.\n\nPAE reduced the symptoms of frequency and urgency of urination without causing side effects like incontinence, sexual dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation (ejaculation into the bladder), or bleeding.\n\nDespite the promising results of this small trial, experts said it was far too early to recommend PAE to patients.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of questions. We really don\u2019t know what the short- and long-term success or complication rates are,\u201d says Anthony Malizia Jr., MD, president and director of the Malizia Clinic, a nonprofit urology specialty center in Atlanta. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how well these particles are localized to the prostate or if they\u2019re going to the pelvis or other parts of the body.\u201d\n\nMalizia notes that in one serious complication reported in the study, the particles appeared to migrate and kill a small part of the bladder wall. The authors report that the dead tissue required surgical removal.\n\nThe study was presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology annual meeting in Chicago.", "images":
