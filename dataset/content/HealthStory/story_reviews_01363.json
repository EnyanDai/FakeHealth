REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nScientists from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) said the protein, called microseminoprotein-beta or MSMB, is found at reduced levels in men diagnosed with the disease and are also lower in men with more aggressive forms of the cancer.\n\n\u201cThe protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,\u201d said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study.\n\nWhitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors.\n\nProstate cancer killed an estimated 258,000 men around the world in 2008 and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease.\n\nThe most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen (PSA). But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment.\n\nA U.S. study published last year found that routine PSA prostate screening has resulted in more than one million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,\u201d said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study.\n\nThe protein \u2014 which regulates prostate cell death \u2014 is produced by normal prostate cells.\n\nThe scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.\n\nThe results, published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) ONE journal, showed that MSMB is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease. They also showed men with aggressive tumors were also likely to have lower levels of the protein in their urine.\n\nCommenting on the study, Kate Holmes of the UK\u2019s Prostate Cancer Charity, said they could prove very valuable in future.\n\n\u201cGiven the known limitations of the PSA blood test, finding a technique to accurately diagnose prostate cancer is the Holy Grail of research into the disease,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAn accurate, reliable urine test for prostate cancer would be an invaluable tool if it is proven to be successful on a large scale.\u201d", "images": ["http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101014&t=2&i=225565941&r=2010-10-14T103157Z_01_BTRE69D0SJE00_RTROPTP_0_USA&w=20", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/fast-track/pre-roll-admantx-ed60b222/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101014&t=2&i=225565941&w=1200&r=2010-10-14T103157Z_01_BTRE69D0SJE00_RTROPTP_0_USA"], "top_img": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101014&t=2&i=225565941&w=1200&r=2010-10-14T103157Z_01_BTRE69D0SJE00_RTROPTP_0_USA", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-urine-idUSTRE69C6DW20101014", "title": "Protein urine test may signal prostate cancer", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "healthNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;healthNews;USWire_EL", "description": "A protein in urine could be a strong indicator of prostate cancer risk, according to British scientists who say their findings could one day be developed into a quick and simple test for the disease.", "Author": "Kate Kelland", "keywords": "Britain,United Kingdom,United States,Hayley Whitaker,Kate Holmes,Kate Kelland,Rosalind Eeles,US,CANCER,PROSTATE,URINE", "news_keywords": "Britain;United Kingdom;United States;Hayley Whitaker;Kate Holmes;Kate Kelland;Rosalind Eeles;US;CANCER;PROSTATE;URINE", "REVISION_DATE": "Thu Oct 14 10:32:01 UTC 2010", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2010-10-14T10:32:01+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Kate Kelland", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-urine-idUSTRE69C6DW20101014", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Protein urine test may signal prostate cancer", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "Britain,United Kingdom,United States,Hayley Whitaker,Kate Holmes,Kate Kelland,Rosalind Eeles,US,CANCER,PROSTATE,URINE", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-CANCER-PROSTATE-URINE", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "false", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Protein urine test may signal prostate cancer", "sailthru.author": "Kate Kelland", "sailthru.date": "2010-10-14T10:32:01+0000", "sailthru.title": "Protein urine test may signal prostate cancer", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Protein urine test may signal prostate cancer", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-urine-idUSTRE69C6DW20101014", "type": "article", "description": "A protein in urine could be a strong indicator of prostate cancer risk, accordin...", "image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101014&t=2&i=225565941&w=1200&r=2010-10-14T103157Z_01_BTRE69D0SJE00_RTROPTP_0_USA", "article": {"published_time": "2010-10-14T10:32:01+0000", "modified_time": "2010-10-14T10:32:01+0000", "section": "Homepage", "author": "Kate Kelland", "tag": "Britain,United Kingdom,United States,Hayley Whitaker,Kate Holmes,Kate Kelland,Rosalind Eeles,US,CANCER,PROSTATE,URINE"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Protein urine test may signal prostate cancer", "description": "A protein in urine could be a strong indicator of prostate cancer risk, according to British scientists who say their findings could one day be developed into a quick and simple test for the disease.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101014&t=2&i=225565941&w=1200&r=2010-10-14T103157Z_01_BTRE69D0SJE00_RTROPTP_0_USA", "src": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20101014&t=2&i=225565941&w=1200&r=2010-10-14T103157Z_01_BTRE69D0SJE00_RTROPTP_0_USA"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Homepage -
