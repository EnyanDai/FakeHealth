able to reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a new study shows.\n\nThe study found that the physical and psychological symptoms of IBS were more effectively managed by people practicing mindfulness meditation than in support group therapy.\n\nSusan Gaylord, PhD, of the University of North Carolina\u2019s program on integrative medicine, set out to evaluate mindfulness meditation as a therapeutic technique for IBS because it has been reported to improve symptoms in other chronic conditions, such as depression and fibromyalgia.\n\nIn a study of 75 women between the ages of 19 and 71, participants were placed in a mindfulness meditation group or a comparison group that offered mutual support for IBS and life\u2019s problems.\n\nEach group took an eight-week course that included weekly sessions and a half-day retreat.\n\nAfter the end of the eight-week period, overall IBS severity was reduced more among patients in the mindfulness meditation group compared to the support group: 26.4% vs. 6.2%.\n\nAfter a three-month follow-up, 38.2% of those in mindfulness meditation reported a reduction in severity of IBS symptoms, compared with only 11.8% who said that among patients who took part in the support group therapy.", "images":
