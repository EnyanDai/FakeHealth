The study shows an association but is not designed to show cause and effect.\n\n\u201cThe results are not meant to suggest everyone should start taking aspirin once monthly to reduce their risk of pancreatic cancer,\u201d says researcher Xiang-Lin Tan, of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minn., in a news release. \u201cIndividuals should discuss use of aspirin with their physicians because the drug carries some side effects.\u201d", "images":
