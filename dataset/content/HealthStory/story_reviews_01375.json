The National Institute of Mental Health recently sponsored its first study of neurofeedback for A.D.H.D.: a randomized, controlled trial of 36 subjects.\n\nThe results are to be announced Oct. 26 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In an interview in the summer, the study\u2019s director, Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State, noted that there had been \u201cquite a bit of improvement\u201d in many of the children\u2019s behavior, as reported by parents and teachers.\n\nDr. Arnold said that if the results bore out that neurofeedback was making the difference, he would seek financing for a broader study, with as many as 100 subjects.\n\nJohn Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University, published a small study in 2007 suggesting that the treatment speeded cognitive processing in elderly people. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that neurofeedback works, that people can change brain activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big questions we still haven\u2019t answered are precisely how it works and how it can be harnessed to treat disorders.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nRussell A. Barkley, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and a leading authority on attention problems, has long dismissed claims that neurofeedback can help. But Dr. Barkley says he was persuaded to take another look after Dutch scientists published an analysis of recent international studies finding significant reductions in impulsiveness and inattention.\n\nStill, Dr. Barkley cautioned that he had yet to see credible evidence confirming claims that such benefits can be long lasting, much less permanent.\n\nAnd another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. William E. Pelham Jr., director of the Center for Children and Families at Florida International University, called neurofeedback \u201ccrackpot charlatanism.\u201d He warned that exaggerated claims for it might lead parents to favor it over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNeurofeedback was developed in the 1960s and \u201970s, with American researchers leading the way. In 1968, M. Barry Sterman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, reported that the training helped cats resist epileptic seizures. Dr. Sterman and others later claimed to have achieved similar benefits with humans.\n\nThe findings prompted a boomlet of interest in which clinicians of varying degrees of respectability jumped into the field, making many unsupported claims about seeming miracle cures and tainting the treatment\u2019s reputation among academic experts. Meanwhile, researchers in Germany and the Netherlands continued to explore neurofeedback\u2019s potential benefits.\n\nA major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. Instead, patients practice routines that seem more like exercising a muscle.\n\nBrain cells communicate with one another, in part, through a constant storm of electrical impulses. Their patterns show up on an electroencephalogram, or EEG, as brain waves with different frequencies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

These issues, they say, can be represented on a \u201cbrain map,\u201d the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Subsequently, a clinician will help a patient learn to slow down or speed up those brain waves, through a process known as operant conditioning. The brain begins by generating fairly random patterns, while the computer software responds with encouragement whenever the activity meets the target.\n\nDr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of \u201cThe Brain That Changes Itself\u201d (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback \u201ca powerful stabilizer of the brain.\u201d Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. Robert Coben, a neuropsychologist in Massapequa Park, N.Y., said he had treated more than 1,000 autistic children over the past seven years and had conducted a clinical study, finding striking reductions in symptoms, as reported by parents.\n\nMaureen and Terrence Magagnos of Lynbrook, N.Y., took their 7-year-old son, Peter, to Dr. Coben after he was given a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder in first grade. \u201cHe had classic symptoms of autism,\u201d said Mr. Magagnos. \u201cHis speech was terrible, he made very little eye contact and he screamed for attention \u2014 literally screamed.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nTheir exceptionally generous insurance covered neurofeedback, so they decided to give it a try, with sessions twice a week for the next five years.\n\nAt the start of the treatment, Dr. Coben said, he discovered that Peter had been suffering tiny, asymptomatic seizures. He says neurofeedback helped stabilize the child\u2019s brain activity, eliminating the seizures. And within three months, said Mr. Magagnos, a retired police officer, Peter\u2019s teachers were calling to report remarkable improvements.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019d say he has \u2018autism light,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cHe still has some symptoms, but he is much more manageable.\u201d\n\nWhether such results can be achieved with other children is a matter of debate. Still, as practitioners lobby for broader acceptance, including insurance recognition, a sure sign of neurofeedback\u2019s increasing popularity is the number of companies selling supposedly mind-altering systems to use at home.\n\nWith names like SmartBrain Technologies and the Learning Curve Inc., they offer equipment purported, respectively, to \u201cpump the neurons\u201d and \u201cmake lasting changes in attention, memory, mood, control, pain, sleep and more.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration regulates all biofeedback equipment as medical devices. The only approved use, however, is for \u201crelaxation.\u201d\n\nPeter Freer, a former grade-school teacher who is chief executive of a North Carolina firm called Unique Logic and Technology, says that since he began his business in 1994, he has sold several thousand of his \u201cPlay Attention\u201d systems, advertised to improve a child\u2019s focus, behavior, academic performance and social behavior.\n\nThe equipment, which costs $1,800, is advertised as \u201ca sophisticated advancement of neurofeedback.\u201d Mr. Freer says his clients include more than 600 school districts. (He adds that his system, as distinct from \u201cclinical\u201d neurofeedback, aims not to change brain waves but rather to put the user in an \u201cattentive state\u201d that makes it easier to learn skills.) Neurofeedback in general is a largely unregulated, with practitioners often devising their own protocols about where on the scalp to place electrodes. Results vary widely, and researchers caution that it is extremely important to choose one\u2019s practitioner with care.\n\nWhen it comes to to the actual devices, Dr. Kerson, at the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, cautioned that they should never be used without experienced supervision.\n\n\u201cOftentimes what people do is find a way to get one of these machines on eBay and use it at home,\u201d she said, adding that unskilled use could interfere with medications or prompt an anxiety attack or a seizure.\n\n\u201cNeurofeedback is a powerful therapy,\u201d she said, \u201cand should be treated that way.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/05/science/05neur2/05neur2-popup.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/05/science/05neurspan/05neurspan-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/05/science/05neurspan/05neurspan-articleLarge.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/05/science/05neur3/05neur3-jumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/05/science/05neurspan/05neurspan-thumbStandard.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Ellison"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05neurofeedback.html", "title": "Neurofeedback Gains Popularity and Second Looks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "applicationName": "article", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069132232", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05neurofeedback.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05neurofeedback.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/1248069132232"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05neurofeedback.html", "title": "Neurofeedback Gains Popularity and Second Looks", "description": "Practitioners say the procedure can address a host of neurological ills \u2014 among them attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, depression and anxiety.
