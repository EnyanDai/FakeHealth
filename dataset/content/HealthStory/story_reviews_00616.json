Data from nearly 9,500 people on five continents shows that amyloid can appear 20 to 30 years before symptoms of dementia, that the vast majority of Alzheimer\u2019s patients have amyloid and that the ApoE4 gene, known to increase Alzheimer\u2019s risk, greatly accelerates amyloid accumulation.\n\nThe findings also confirm that amyloid screening, by PET scan or cerebral spinal fluid test, can help identify people for clinical trials of drugs to prevent Alzheimer\u2019s. Such screening is increasingly used in research. Experts say previous trials of anti-amyloid drugs on people with dementia failed because their brains were already too damaged or because some patients, not screened for amyloid, may not have had Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe papers indicate that amyloid imaging is important to be sure that the drugs are being tested on people who have amyloid,\u201d said Dr. Roger Rosenberg, the director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, who wrote an editorial about the studies.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pam Belluck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/health/studies-confirm-brain-plaque-can-help-predict-alzheimers.html", "title": "Studies Confirm Brain Plaque Can Help Predict Alzheimer\u2019s", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2015-05-20T00:35:33.000Z", "modified": "2015-05-20T00:35:31.000Z", "section": "Health", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/pam-belluck", "tag": "Dementia", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000003692903, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/4993db4d-7f77-5aa9-a96b-6f8c2959b003", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/75ac60a0f8aa4224a7137128875bb8ac", "description": "Data from the largest analysis to date of amyloid plaques showed they can appear 20 or 30 years before dementia symptoms.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "byl": "By Pam Belluck", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": "Alzheimer's,,Journal of the American Medical Assn,Old age;elderly;senior citizens,Research,Genetics and Heredity,Dementia", "pdate": 20150519, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/health/studies-confirm-brain-plaque-can-help-predict-alzheimers.html", "type": "article", "title": "Studies Confirm Brain Plaque Can Help Predict Alzheimer\u2019s", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "description": "Data from the largest analysis to date of amyloid plaques showed they can appear 20 or 30 years before dementia symptoms."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/health/studies-confirm-brain-plaque-can-help-predict-alzheimers.html", "title": "Studies Confirm Brain Plaque Can Help Predict Alzheimer\u2019s", "description": "Data from the largest analysis to date of amyloid plaques showed they can appear 20 or 30 years before dementia symptoms.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003692903"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "health", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/health/studies-confirm-brain-plaque-can-help-predict-alzheimers.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003692903", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/health/studies-confirm-brain-plaque-can-help-predict-alzheimers.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/health/studies-confirm-brain-plaque-can-help-predict-alzheimers.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1432094400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
