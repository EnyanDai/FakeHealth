REUTERS/Ruben Sprich/File Photo\n\nMixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies.\n\nThe latest trial success follows Roche\u2019s announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail.\n\nWhile Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,\u201d said Sandra Horning, Roche\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nShe also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals\u2019 cheaper copies.\n\nAnalysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an \u201calready robust\u201d set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq\u2019s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer.\n\n\u201cWe continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,\u201d Baader\u2019s Bruno Bulic said.\n\n\u201cFacing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche\u2019s profitability going forward.\u201d", "images":
