The benefits may go beyond cardiac health,\u201d Patel said in a telephone interview.\n\nFor the study, Gong Yang and colleagues at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Shanghai Cancer Institute, and the National Cancer Institute looked at data from a large study of Chinese women called the Shanghai Women\u2019s Health Study. They pulled out the records of 444 of the women, who had lung cancer.\n\nThe women had all filled out questionnaires that included details of what they normally ate. They did this twice \u2013 when they enrolled in the study, and two years later.\n\nOf the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during the three years of follow-up, the researchers wrote. \u201cInitial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factor,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWomen who reported eating the least soy were 1.8 times as likely to die, on average. Those who ate the most were about 11 percent less likely to die.\n\n\u201cThis finding, along with our previous observation of an approximately 40 percent reduction in risk of incident lung cancer associated with high intake of soy food, provides further support for the role of soy food intake in lung cancer development and prognosis,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nMost of the women in the study had never been smokers, and there\u2019s a lot of evidence to suggest that lung cancer is a different disease in smokers versus non-smokers. \u201cIn Asian countries, 80 percent of women with lung cancer are never- smokers,\u201d Patel said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if there is an inherited susceptibility to it,\u201d she added. There might be an infectious disease that causes some cases of lung cancer \u2014like the virus that causes cervical cancer, or the bacteria that causes stomach cancer.\n\n\u201cAlthough the risks are probably different for American women for developing lung cancer, I do think it is a call to action for more research about how we develop lung cancer,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThere are probably 30,000 people in the U.S. who never smoked and who have lung cancer.\u201d\n\nLung cancer kills 160,000 Americans a year. It\u2019s diagnosed in 110,000 women and 118,000 men a year in the United States alone. It accounts for 27 percent of all cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nStudies suggest that people who eat the most soy have a lower risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Women may have fewer menopausal symptoms, and perhaps a lower risk of some cancers.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration says soy products may carry a heart-healthy label saying that soy may reduce cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be difficult to eat enough soy to be protected, Patel noted. \u201cThe high soy level patients were eating what the FDA has said is heart-healthy, or 25 grams of soy a day,\u2019 she said.\n\nStudies have shown that supplements containing soy protein don\u2019t have much health benefit. But foods such as soy milk, tofu and edamame do. \u201cWe think that consuming food in their whole forms is more important than the supplements,\u201d Patel said.\n\nSome researchers have wondered whether Western people who eat more soy food are benefiting from the soy itself, or because they perhaps use it as a substitute for meat and dairy foods. Patel says this study in China, where soy is a normal part of the diet and where dairy foods are less commonly eaten, suggests it\u2019s the soy itself that adds the benefit.\n\nSoy and many other plant foods contain hormone-like substances called phytoestrogens. These may be affecting a cell compound called estrogen receptor beta, she said. That compound interacts with another one called epidermal growth factor receptor or EGRF, which is known to play a role in many cases on lung cancer.\n\n\u201cLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death. There are many never-smokers with lung cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople should consider eating a diet that is healthy. By all accounts one that includes soy decreases cardiac risks and could also affect lung cancer,\u201d Patel concluded.\n\nHow can people add soy to their diets? A cup of vanilla soymilk poured over cereal provides 6 grams of soy protein, while an eight-ounce glass provides 8 grams. A soy burger delivers 10 grams of soy protein, while 3 ounces of tofu has 8.5 grams.\n\nRelated:\n\nSoy supplements don't help menopause\n\nSoy may keep breast cancer from coming back\n\nLung cancer on NBCNews", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/SiteManagement/Newsletters/Assets/Photos/Twitter-icon2.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://log.newsvine.com/poke.gif?x=0|26&get=c17459143&rand=137677641&do=nbcnews.com&ad=308:9:80;44::;308:9:80;367:367:1249;308:9:80;367:367:1249;308:9:80;367:367:1249;25:25:1149", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/abstractmartinblog/images/icons-email.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/abstractmartinblog/images/icons-twitter.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/130313-tofu-hmed-354p.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/130313-tofu-hmed-354p.photoblog600.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/SiteManagement/Newsletters/Assets/Photos/Facebook-icon2.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/abstractmartinblog/images/icons-feed.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=maggie-fox63F8726C-30BB-E381-DF90-4ED5CDA00084.jpg&width=60", "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://lib.newsvine.com/chrome/abstractmartinblog/images/nbcnews-Footerlogo.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201im_/http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/130313-tofu-hmed-354p.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Fox", "Senior Writer", "Nbc News"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20130327235201/http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/25/17459143-women-who-ate-more-soy-survive-lung-cancer-better-study-finds?lite", "title": "Women who ate more soy survive lung cancer better, study finds", "meta_data": {"title": "Women who ate more soy survive lung cancer better, study finds - Vitals", "description": "Soy foods, long shown to help lower the risk of cancer, may also help people survive at least some forms of cancer better, researchers reported on Monday.
