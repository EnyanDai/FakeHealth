Sensitive means it\u2019s unlikely that the test would miss a case of cancer. Specific means that the test is unlikely to be positive if cancer isn\u2019t really present.\n\nBased on the levels of PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG detected, the men were given numerical scores that were classified as being high, medium, or low.\n\nThose scores were then compared to the biopsy results.\n\n\u201cThe men in the highest group have a risk of cancer on biopsy of about 70% and those in the lowest group have a risk of cancer of about 20%,\u201d says Tomlins.\n\nResearchers then narrowed their analysis to see how the urine test scores matched the men\u2019s Gleason score, which helps doctors gauge how aggressive a cancer may be.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that your risk of having an aggressive cancer if you\u2019re in the high group is about 40%, and if you\u2019re in the low group, the risk of having an aggressive cancer is only about 7%,\u201d Tomlins says.\n\nThe company that developed the test, Gen-Probe, helped to pay for the study, and several authors said they had a personal financial interest in the technology.\n\n\u201cThis is great science,\u201d says J. Stephen Jones, MD, chairman of the department of regional urology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.\n\nNow that the researchers have validated the test, further studies in larger, more diverse populations will be important to understand how it is best used.\n\n\u201cThe real key is using this or any test to help drive decisions,\u201d says Jones, who was not involved in the research, \u201cIf it helps me to know who to biopsy or not biopsy, that\u2019s massively valuable information.\u201d", "images":
