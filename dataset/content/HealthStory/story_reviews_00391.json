The children were given food and drinks totaling the same number of calories, fat, protein and carbohydrates as their typical diets.\n\nThe only change was their sugar intake: The researchers swapped foods high in added sugars, like pastries and sweetened yogurts, for options like bagels and pizza. This lowered dietary sugar from 28 percent to 10 percent, and fructose from 12 percent to 4 percent of total calories.\n\nAfter nine days, the researchers found a 33 percent drop in triglycerides, a type of fat tied to heart disease; a 49 percent reduction in a protein called apoC-III that is tied to high triglyceride levels; and large reductions in small, dense LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease.\n\nThough this study is small and short-term, it builds on this group\u2019s previous research implicating added sugars as a contributor to metabolic disorders and heart disease.\n\n\u201cSugar calories are not like other carbohydrate calories,\u201d said Dr. Robert Lustig, a co-author of the study and professor of pediatrics at Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cWithout changing total carbohydrate, or fat, or protein, we were able to accomplish this enormous improvement in their cardiovascular risk factors,\u201d unrelated to weight loss, he said.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/20/health/well_nutrition/well_nutrition-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/20/health/well_nutrition/well_nutrition-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/marketing/newsletters/images/Running_75.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/31/well/family/well-family-exerciseask/well-family-exerciseask-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/29/science/well-klass-smallpenis/well-klass-smallpenis-articleInline.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v5/well/well_post.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/20/health/well_nutrition/well_nutrition-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Rabkin Peachman"], "canonical_link": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/cutting-sugar-from-diet-rapidly-improves-heart-health-markers/", "title": "Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers", "meta_data": {"communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers ( 20160719 )", "communityAssetURL": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/cutting-sugar-from-diet-rapidly-improves-heart-health-markers/", "PT": "Blogs", "PST": "Blog Post", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000004539110, "author": "Rachel Rabkin Peachman", "CLMST": "Rachel Rabkin Peachman", "byl": "Rachel Rabkin Peachman", "GBLC": "Eat;Featured;Live", "PUV": "normal", "article": {"published_time": 1468940423, "modified_time": "2016-07-25T16:24:50-04:00", "section": "Health", "tag": "Live", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp"}, "PUD": 20160719, "pdate": 20160719, "ptime": 20160719110023, "utime": 20160725162450, "DISPLAYDATE": "July 19, 2016", "dat": "July 19, 2016", "CG": "Health", "SCG": "well", "BN": "well", "robots": "noodp", "des": "Cholesterol;Diet and Nutrition;Heart;Obesity;Sugar", "keywords": "Cholesterol,Diet and Nutrition,Heart,Obesity,Sugar,Eat,Featured,Live", "news_keywords": "Cholesterol,Heart,Obesity,Sugar", "description": "Obese children who cut sugar from their diets saw improvements in markers of heart disease after just nine days.", "hdl": "Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers", "og": {"title": "Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers", "type": "article", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/cutting-sugar-from-diet-rapidly-improves-heart-health-markers/", "site_name": "Well", "description": "Obese children who cut sugar from their diets saw improvements in markers of heart disease after just nine days.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/20/health/well_nutrition/well_nutrition-facebookJumbo.jpg"}, "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/20/health/well_nutrition/well_nutrition-thumbLarge.jpg", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Cutting Sugar Rapidly Improves Heart Health Markers", "url": "//well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/cutting-sugar-from-diet-rapidly-improves-heart-health-markers/", "description": "Obese children who cut sugar from their diets saw improvements in markers of heart disease after just nine days.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/20/health/well_nutrition/well_nutrition-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimeswell"}, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/20/health/well_nutrition/well_nutrition-thumbLarge.jpg", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well/eat", "categories": "eat,live"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1468900800.0, "source": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
