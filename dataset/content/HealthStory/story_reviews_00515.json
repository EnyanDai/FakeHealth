The drugs affect different parts of the same signaling pathway. The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib were shown in a clinical study of 495 patients with previously untreated, advanced melanoma that demonstrate the BRAF V600 mutation. The government agency said that common side effects of the Cotellic and vemurafenib combination was diarrhea, sensitivity to ultraviolet light, nausea, fever and vomiting. Cotellic could also cause \u201csevere\u201d side effects including heart damage, new skin tumors, retinal detachment, skin rash, liver damage and hemorrhage. Cotellic has received orphan drug designation, for which the FDA has provided incentives that include quicker approval, tax benefits for the developer and seven years\u2019 protection from competition after approval. Conventional drugs typically get five years protection. Orphan drugs are defined as experimental treatments for diseases with fewer than 200,000 patients at any one time. Cotellic and Zelboraf are both marketed by California-based Genentech, a member of the Roche Group.
