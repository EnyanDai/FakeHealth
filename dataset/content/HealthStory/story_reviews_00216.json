We think it could be used to make clinical decisions about whether a PARP-inhibitor is working within as little as four to eight weeks of starting therapy.\n\n\u201cNot only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer as well.\u201d\n\nBy testing cancer DNA in the bloodstream, the researchers found they could pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer were likely to benefit from treatment with the drug.\n\n\n\nThey also used the test to analyse DNA in the blood after treatment had started, so people who were not responding could be identified and switched to alternative therapy in as little as four to eight weeks.\n\nThirdly, they used the test to monitor a patient\u2019s blood throughout treatment to quickly pick up signs that the cancer was evolving genetically and might be becoming resistant to the drugs.\n\nThe researchers collected blood samples from 49 men at the Royal Marsden with advanced prostate cancer enrolled in the phase II clinical trial of olaparib.\n\n\n\nThe drug is effective at killing cancer cells that have errors in genes which would otherwise keep them healthy. Some patients respond to olaparib for years but in others the treatment can fail early or the cancer can evolve resistance.\n\nThe ICR chief executive, Prof Paul Workman, said the test could \u201cusher in a new era of precision medicine for prostate cancer\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cBlood tests for cancer promise to be truly revolutionary. They are cheap and simple to use, but most importantly, because they aren\u2019t invasive, they can be employed or applied to routinely monitor patients to spot early if treatment is failing \u2013 offering patients the best chance of surviving their disease.\u201d\n\nThe research was funded by the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Prostate Cancer UK, Movember, Cancer Research UK and the National Institute for Health Research.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif",
