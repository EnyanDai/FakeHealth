It also appeared to prevent colds in people who used it over the course of about five months.\n\n\u201cThis is great news,\u201d says Kay Dickersin, PhD, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and director of the U.S. Cochrane Center. \u201cWe really don\u2019t have interventions for colds that work.\u201d\n\nThe review of 15 studies with 1,360 participants was published by the Cochrane group, an international collaboration of researchers that reviews evidence behind therapeutic interventions. It updates a 1999 Cochrane review that found no strong evidence to recommend zinc as a help for colds.\n\n\u201cThe evidence from the recent trials does support the use of zinc lozenges in treatment of common cold,\u201d says study researcher Meenu Singh, MD, a pediatric pulmonologist at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research in Chandigarh, India.", "images":
