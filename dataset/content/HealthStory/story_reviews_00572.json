If this had not happened, \"the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater,\" they surmised.\n\nA separate analysis by the same group, also published in The Lancet, looked at bisphosphonates, which are typically used for osteoporosis. Researchers at Sheffield University found that in postmenopausal women during the first 10 years after diagnosis of breast cancer, the drug could reduce the risk of death by 18 per cent.\n\nAD\n\nUsing the two drugs together as a one-two punch may be even more powerful.\n\nRichard Gray, a professor at the University of Oxford and who served as the lead statistician for both studies, said that half of all women with breast cancer are postmenopausal with hormone-sensitive tumors and could potentially benefit from both drugs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe drugs are complementary, because the main side effect of aromatase inhibitors is an increase in bone loss and fractures, while bisphosphonates reduce bone loss and fractures as well as improving survival,\" he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yzdty-NGFb5y_mvLCtqhPgeCKWc=/150x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JMLGTFGIMY5YLCLDF6XKNXJFSY.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XWc0UjvD8FHR_ttobcGGol4B4Y4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4RCIUG32L43X5KSLT2NW7MBHHY.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KHaoGQ4Oyc92lVjrWLXcV-YX5GI=/90x90/smart/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/8c3365b4-0b14-4270-ab2a-627279e3b650.png"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XWc0UjvD8FHR_ttobcGGol4B4Y4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4RCIUG32L43X5KSLT2NW7MBHHY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Eunjung Cha", "National Reporter", "Staff Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/07/27/breast-cancer-study-inexpensive-one-two-punch-of-combining-two-generics-may-be-more-powerful-than-wonder-drug-tamoxifen/", "title": "Could one-two punch of generics for breast cancer be more powerful than wonder drug tamoxifen?", "meta_data": {"description": "A study in The Lancet found that an existing class of drug could not only reduce recurrence rates but risk of death.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/07/27/breast-cancer-study-inexpensive-one-two-punch-of-combining-two-generics-may-be-more-powerful-than-wonder-drug-tamoxifen/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XWc0UjvD8FHR_ttobcGGol4B4Y4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4RCIUG32L43X5KSLT2NW7MBHHY.jpg", "title": "Could one-two punch of generics for breast cancer be more powerful than wonder drug tamoxifen?", "description": "A study in The Lancet found that an existing class of drug could not only reduce recurrence rates but risk of death."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Could one-two punch of generics for breast cancer be more powerful than wonder drug tamoxifen?", "description": "A study in The Lancet found that an existing class of drug could not only reduce recurrence rates but risk of death."}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1437969600.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
